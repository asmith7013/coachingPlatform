 # Data Flow Guidelines

Data management follows strict patterns for consistency, security, and maintainability. These guidelines ensure proper data handling throughout the application lifecycle.

## Data Flow Principles

- **Schema Validation** - All data is validated against defined schemas
- **Centralized Error Handling** - Consistent approach to error management
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear separation between data fetching, transformation, and rendering
- **Sanitization Layer** - Data is sanitized at system boundaries
- **Predictable State Management** - Well-defined patterns for managing application state
