 # Architecture Guidelines

The platform architecture follows a modular, layer-based approach with clear separation of concerns. These guidelines help maintain consistent architecture patterns across the codebase.

## Key Architecture Principles

- **Modular Design** - Code is organized into focused, reusable modules
- **Clear Boundaries** - Well-defined interfaces between system components
- **Dependency Management** - Careful control of dependencies to prevent coupling
- **Consistent Patterns** - Standard approaches to common architectural challenges
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works first, with enhanced features added gracefully
