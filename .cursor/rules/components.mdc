 # Component System Guidelines

The component system follows a layered approach with atomic, domain, and composed components. These guidelines ensure consistent, reusable, and maintainable UI elements.

## Component System Principles

- **Atomic Design** - Building complex UIs from simple, reusable components
- **Composition over Inheritance** - Preferring component composition for flexibility
- **Single Responsibility** - Each component has a clear, focused purpose
- **Accessibility First** - Components are designed for universal access
- **Performance Optimization** - Components are optimized for minimal re-renders
