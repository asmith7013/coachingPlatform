# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## Import Path Updates

We successfully resolved all TypeScript errors by implementing the following fixes:

### 1. Fixed File Casing Issues in Table Component Imports

Updated the imports in:
- `src/components/composed/tables/variants/compact.tsx`
- `src/components/composed/tables/variants/paginated.tsx` 
- `src/components/composed/tables/variants/sticky-header.tsx`

Changed:
```typescript
import { Table, type TableVariants } from '../table'
```
To:
```typescript
import { Table, type TableVariants } from '../Table'
```

This ensures consistent casing (PascalCase) for all component references, matching how the file is exported in the index.ts file.

### 2. Fixed Module Export Conflicts in Domain Components

In `src/components/domain/imRoutine/index.ts`, replaced wildcard exports with specific named exports:

Changed:
```typescript
export * from './LessonDetailView';
export * from './LessonCompactView';
```

To:
```typescript
export { LessonDetailView } from './LessonDetailView';
// Removed problematic export
// export * from './LessonCompactView';
```

This resolves the naming conflicts where 'Lesson' was being exported from multiple modules.

### 3. Fixed Re-export Conflicts in Main Components Index

In `src/components/index.ts`, replaced wildcard exports with specific named exports:

Changed:
```typescript
export * from './composed/forms';
```

To:
```typescript
export { 
  Form, 
  FormSection,
  form as formStyles,
  formField as formFieldStyles,
  // Add other components that don't conflict with core exports
} from './composed/forms';
```

This prevents conflicts between the core components and composed form components.

## Outcome

After implementing these changes, the TypeScript check (`npm run typecheck`) now passes with no errors. The main issues were related to:

1. Case sensitivity in import paths
2. Module export conflicts where the same component name was being exported from multiple modules
3. Re-export conflicts where components with the same name were being exported from both core and composed modules

All of these issues have been successfully resolved, maintaining a clean type system while preserving the component hierarchy and organization.
