# Scope of Work Details

## Services

Teaching Lab is developing a series of structured, evidence-based professional learning (PL) courses to build the capacity of instructional coaches supporting high-quality instructional materials (HQIM). These courses will strengthen coaches' ability to guide educators in implementing research-based math and science instruction using OpenSciEd, Amplify Science, iReady Math, and Amplify Desmos Math.

We are seeking expert content developers with deep knowledge of these curricula to collaborate on the design and development of both introductory (101) and advanced (201) coaching-focused PL courses.

## Responsibilities

Content developers will contribute to the design and development of professional learning courses aligned to their area(s) of expertise. Services include:

### 1. Amplify Desmos Math Foundational PL Session: Content Design and Development Overview

#### Priority Focus:
We are prioritizing the development of a foundational professional learning session that supports coaches and facilitators in understanding how to effectively work with Amplify Desmos Math Kâ€“12. This session will include:

* How Amplify Desmos Math aligns to the Common Core State Standards and the math instructional shifts
* An explanation of Amplify Desmos' design principles and instructional philosophy
* An overview of unit and lesson internalization using Teaching Lab tools, including how to ground instructional decisions in the structure of the curriculum

This session should be designed for both in-person and asynchronous learning formats, and must include:
* Facilitation prompts for in-person delivery, and separate
* Activity prompts for asynchronous completion at participants' own pace

While the visual design team will create final slides, the session designer will be responsible for fully scripting and structuring the session using Teaching Lab's PL session overview planning materials.

### 2. Secondary Focus:
As part of the course design, you will review a set of coaching scenarios and identify Amplify Desmos Math-specific nuances that would help a coach navigate these sticky situations more effectively.

### 3. General Responsibilities

#### Content Design and Planning Responsibilities
* Participate in planning meetings with the course design lead and relevant stakeholders to clarify goals and expectations
* Review existing Teaching Lab PL materials, Amplify Desmos Math curricular frameworks, and instructional resources to identify areas of alignment and opportunity
* Work asynchronously to develop the scope, sequence, and learning goals for the session, ensuring alignment with broader course outcomes

#### Course Development Responsibilities:
* Develop detailed session materials including:
  * Facilitator guide
  * Participant handouts
  * Sample artifacts (aligned to Amplify Desmos Math use)
* Ensure all content aligns to research-based best practices in math instruction, particularly those relevant to the instructional shifts and the CVA trajectory
* Maintain a clear connection to Teaching Lab's approach to unit and lesson internalization, preparing facilitators to lead from both a strategic and instructional lens

### 4. Iteration and Feedback
* Revise and refine materials based on feedback from internal reviews and stakeholder input
