# The 9-Slide Worked Example Framework

This document explains the pedagogical rationale behind the Scaffolded Guidance slide structure.

## Overview

The 9-slide structure is intentionally designed to move from concept to application without overwhelming the student. It's grounded in:

- **Cognitive Load Theory** - Breaking complex problems into micro-steps
- **Active Prediction Pedagogy** - Forcing mental commitment before revealing answers
- **Transfer of Learning** - Testing application to new contexts without scaffolding

---

## Slide Breakdown (The "What")

### Slide 1: The Anchor (Title & Big Idea)

**Content:**
- Unit/Lesson number
- Student-friendly definition of the concept
- One simple numerical example

**Why:**
Sets the stage. Translates "teacher speak" (objectives) into "student speak" (big idea).

**Example:**
```
Title: "7.2 Proportional Relationships"
Big Idea: "Find patterns by identifying the constant rate"
Example: "If 5 minutes = 250 views, then 1 minute = 50 views"
```

---

### Slide 2: The Hook (Contextual Problem)

**Content:**
- First scenario with relevant image (e.g., "The Viral Video")
- Blank table showing the relationship
- Context that grounds the math in reality

**Why:**
Answers "When would I use this?" before introducing calculations. Provides cognitive scaffolding through familiar contexts.

**Example:**
```
Scenario: A YouTube video is going viral!
[Icon: Video/TrendingUp]
[Table showing minutes vs. views with some cells blank]
```

---

### Slides 3-6: The Deconstructed Worked Example

These four slides form two "Prediction Pairs" - the core of the active learning approach.

#### Slides 3 & 4: Finding the Constant

**Slide 3 - The "Ask":**
- Shows data table with visual highlighting
- Asks a "Check for Understanding" question
- **Critically: Does NOT show the calculation yet**
- Uses visual focus (highlighting boxes/rows) instead of heavy text

**Slide 4 - The "Reveal":**
- Shows the calculation
- Displays the answer
- Explains the reasoning

**Why this structure:**
Separating question from answer forces students to mentally commit to a strategy before seeing if they're right. If both were on the same slide, students would simply read the answer.

**Example:**
```
Slide 3 (Ask):
"Look at the first row. How did I know to write 250 ÷ 5?"
[Highlights first row of table: 5 minutes | 250 views]

Slide 4 (Reveal):
Calculation: 250 ÷ 5 = 50
"We divided total views by minutes to find the rate: 50 views per minute"
```

#### Slides 5 & 6: Applying the Constant

**Slide 5 - The "Ask":**
- Shows the next step in the problem
- Highlights the relevant data
- Asks how to use the constant we just found

**Slide 6 - The "Reveal":**
- Shows the multiplication/application
- Explains how the constant solves the problem

**Why:**
Separates "finding the pattern" from "using the pattern" - two distinct cognitive steps that shouldn't be conflated.

**Example:**
```
Slide 5 (Ask):
"Now that we know the rate is 50 views/minute, how do we find views at 12 minutes?"
[Highlights row: 12 minutes | ??? views]

Slide 6 (Reveal):
Calculation: 50 × 12 = 600
"Multiply the rate by the new time to find total views"
```

---

### Slide 7: The "Metacognition" Slide (Reasoning)

**Content:**
- Summary of rules or patterns discovered
- Explains the "why" behind the math
- Bridges computation to conceptual understanding
- **First time abstract language/variables can appear**

**Why:**
Supports students who are conceptually strong but computationally weak. Makes the implicit explicit.

**Example:**
```
"Pattern for Proportional Relationships:"
1. Find the constant rate (divide one quantity by the other)
2. Use the rate to find missing values (multiply rate × input)
3. All rows in the table follow the same rate

Math Rule: y = kx, where k is the constant rate
```

---

### Slides 8-9: Independent Practice

**Content:**
- Two new scenarios (e.g., "Game Update Downloads", "Drone Flight")
- **Identical mathematical structure** to the worked example
- **Zero scaffolding** - no step-by-step guidance
- Only the table and context

**Why:**
Tests transfer of knowledge. Can the student apply the logic from the video example to a drone example? This reveals true understanding vs. memorization.

**Example:**
```
Slide 8:
"A mobile game update is downloading at a constant rate"
[Icon: Download/Smartphone]
[Table with missing values]

Slide 9:
"A drone flies at a constant speed"
[Icon: Drone/Wind]
[Table with missing values]
```

---

## The Arrangement Strategy (The "How")

### The "Prediction Pair" Technique

The worked example is NOT a continuous lecture. It's arranged in pairs:

**A-Slide (The Ask):**
- Shows data
- Highlights focus area
- Asks "Check for Understanding" question
- **Does NOT show math**

**B-Slide (The Reveal):**
- Shows calculation
- Shows answer
- Explains reasoning

**Why it works:**
Forces active prediction rather than passive consumption. Students must think before seeing the answer.

---

## Visual Stability Across Slides (Reducing Cognitive Load)

### The Whiteboard Metaphor

When a teacher explains a problem on a whiteboard, they:
1. **Draw the problem once** (table, diagram, equation)
2. **Keep it in the same spot** on the board
3. **Add annotations around it** (circles, arrows, calculations)
4. **Never erase and redraw** the original problem in a new location

This approach minimizes cognitive load by letting students focus on the NEW information (annotations) rather than re-finding the FAMILIAR information (the table).

### Why Element Movement is Harmful

**The Problem:**
If the data table moves position between slides, students must:
1. **Visually search** for the table's new location
2. **Re-orient** their mental model
3. **Track movement** instead of tracking content changes

This creates **extrinsic cognitive load** - mental effort spent on navigation rather than learning.

**Research Basis:**
- **Split Attention Effect** (Sweller, 1999): Students perform worse when related information appears in different locations
- **Eye Tracking Studies**: Unnecessary eye movement increases cognitive processing time by 20-40%
- **Spatial Contiguity Principle** (Mayer, 2009): Related elements should stay close together

### Implementation Guidelines

#### For Slides 2-6 (The Worked Example Sequence)

**Slide 2 - The Hook (establishes position):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📹 Viral Video Problem          │
│                                 │
│       ┌─────────────┐           │
│       │   TABLE     │  ← Position established
│       │   (x, y)    │           │
│       └─────────────┘           │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Slide 3 - Ask (table stays put, highlight added):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📹 How did I know to divide?    │
│                                 │
│       ┌─────────────┐           │
│       │   TABLE     │  ← SAME position
│       │   (x, y)    │           │
│       └─────────────┘           │
│           ↑↑↑                   │
│       [Row 1 highlighted]       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Slide 4 - Reveal (table stays put, calculation appears beside):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📹 Calculation                  │
│                                 │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌──────────┐ │
│  │   TABLE     │  │ 250 ÷ 5  │ │  ← Calculation appears
│  │   (x, y)    │  │ = 50     │ │     to the RIGHT
│  └─────────────┘  └──────────┘ │
│   ↑ Still here!                │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Slide 5 - Ask (same position, different highlight):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📹 How do we find the answer?   │
│                                 │
│       ┌─────────────┐           │
│       │   TABLE     │  ← STILL same position
│       │   (x, y)    │           │
│       └─────────────┘           │
│              ↑↑↑                │
│       [Row 3 highlighted]       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Slide 6 - Reveal (same position, new calculation):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📹 Final Answer                 │
│                                 │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌──────────┐ │
│  │   TABLE     │  │ 50 × 12  │ │  ← New calculation
│  │   (x, y)    │  │ = 600    │ │     (same position)
│  └─────────────┘  └──────────┘ │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### CSS/Component Implementation

**Use Fixed Positioning for Tables:**
```css
.slide-table {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;              /* Centered horizontally */
  top: 45%;               /* Slightly above center */
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transition: none;       /* NO animation/movement */
}

.slide-annotation {
  position: absolute;
  /* Flexible positioning around the table */
}
```

**Layout Variants:**

| Table Position | Best For | Annotation Space |
|---------------|----------|------------------|
| **Center** | Simple tables, standard problems | Annotations above/below |
| **Left (40%)** | Complex calculations needed | Large calculation area on right |
| **Top (30%)** | Questions with diagrams | Diagram space below |

**Rule of Thumb:** Choose the position on Slide 2, then LOCK IT for slides 3-6.

### Annotation Strategies (What CAN Move)

Since the table is stationary, use these techniques to guide attention:

1. **Border Highlighting**
   ```css
   .highlighted-row {
     outline: 3px solid #FFD700;  /* Gold border */
     animation: pulse 1.5s ease-in-out;
   }
   ```

2. **Callout Boxes** (appear to the side)
   ```
   [Table]  →  "Start here!"
   ```

3. **Arrow Indicators**
   ```
   [Table]
      ↑
   "This row"
   ```

4. **Floating Calculations** (overlay, don't replace)
   ```
   Position calculation boxes with z-index layering
   ```

## The Approach to Worked Examples

### Scaffolded Annotation

**Principle 1: Zero-Word Initial Focus**
On "Ask" slides, use purely visual highlighting (colored boxes, arrows) to draw attention without requiring heavy text reading.

**Principle 2: "Why" Over "What"**
Questions don't ask "What is 250 ÷ 5?" (computation).
They ask "How did I know to write 250 ÷ 5?" (strategy).

**Principle 3: Step-by-Step Logic**
1. **Find the Constant** - Isolate the unit rate (the "magic number")
2. **Apply the Constant** - Use that rate with multiplication
3. **Reverse the Constant** (optional) - Division to find input from output

## Generalizing the Framework (The Checklist)

To create this for ANY math topic:

### The "Real World" Rule
✅ Do NOT use abstract numbers (x and y) until Slide 7
✅ Always start with context (Videos, Speed, Cost, Weight)
✅ Use scenarios relevant to student interests

### The "Two-Slide" Rule
✅ Never show step and solution on same slide
✅ Always separate Question (Ask) from Explanation (Reveal)
✅ Force prediction before revelation

### The Visual Anchor Rule
✅ Every problem needs an icon or photo
✅ Helps differentiate "The Video Problem" vs "The Drone Problem"
✅ Better than "Problem 1" and "Problem 3"

### The Reasoning Bridge
✅ Always include Slide 7 that explains the pattern in English
✅ Supports conceptual learners
✅ Makes abstract connections explicit

---

## Research Basis

### Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)
Breaking complex problems into micro-steps prevents working memory overload. Each "Prediction Pair" addresses ONE cognitive decision.

### Active Retrieval Practice (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006)
Forcing students to predict answers (even incorrectly) strengthens long-term retention more than passive review.

### Transfer of Learning (Perkins & Salomon, 1992)
Slides 8-9 test "far transfer" - applying learned principles to new contexts without explicit guidance.

### Worked Example Effect (Atkinson et al., 2000)
Studied examples with step-by-step explanations are more effective than problem-solving alone, but only when properly sequenced and scaffolded.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Showing question and answer together** - Eliminates prediction opportunity
❌ **Using variables too early** - Creates abstraction barrier for struggling students
❌ **Skipping Slide 7** - Leaves conceptual understanding implicit
❌ **Making practice problems easier** - Slides 8-9 must be equally rigorous
❌ **Over-scaffolding practice** - Independence requires removing all hints
❌ **Text-heavy "Ask" slides** - Visual highlighting is more effective
❌ **Moving tables between slides** - Creates visual search burden and cognitive overload
❌ **Repositioning elements without purpose** - Every layout change must serve pedagogy

## Customization Guidelines

### For Different Grade Levels

**Elementary (3-5):**
- Use more concrete contexts (cookies, toys, animals)
- Larger font sizes, fewer numbers per table
- 2-step worked example may be sufficient (slides 3-4 only)

**Middle School (6-8):**
- Teen-relevant contexts (gaming, social media, sports)
- Standard 4-step worked example (slides 3-6)
- Can introduce variables on Slide 7

**High School (9-12):**
- More complex contexts (economics, physics, data science)
- May extend to 6-step worked example (3 prediction pairs)
- Earlier introduction of formal notation

### For Different Math Topics

**Proportional Relationships:** Find rate → Apply rate
**Linear Equations:** Isolate variable → Verify solution
**Geometry:** Identify formula → Substitute values → Simplify
**Statistics:** Calculate measure → Interpret meaning
**Functions:** Identify rule → Apply to new input

The 2-step structure (Find/Apply) generalizes across most topics.

## Success Metrics

A well-designed worked example deck should:
- ✅ Students can articulate the strategy (not just compute)
- ✅ 70%+ accuracy on independent practice (Slides 8-9)
- ✅ Students can explain "why" the method works
- ✅ Transfer to similar problems in different contexts
- ✅ Engagement maintained through all 9 slides (no drop-off)
