# Pedagogical Framework for Worked Example Slide Decks

This document explains the research-based framework behind the slide structure.

## Core Principles

### 1. Cognitive Load Theory
Breaking complex problems into micro-steps prevents cognitive overload. Students can focus on one decision point at a time.

### 2. Active Prediction Pedagogy
Separating questions from answers forces mental commitment before revealing solutions. This active engagement improves retention.

### 3. Transfer of Learning
Independent practice (final slides) tests whether students can apply logic to new contexts without scaffolding.

## Slide Structure (7-9 Slides)

### Slide 1: Learning Goal
**Purpose**: Translate objectives into student-friendly language with concrete example
**Content**:
- Student-facing learning goal
- Simple numerical example
- Optional unit/lesson badge

### Slide 2: Problem Setup (Worked Example)
**Purpose**: Provide context and show complete problem
**Content**:
- Engaging scenario
- Problem statement
- Visual representation (table, diagram, graph)
- No solution yet

### Slides 3-6 (or 3-8): Step-by-Step with CFU
**Structure**: Pairs of Ask + Reveal slides

**Ask Slide**:
- Shows visual with annotation/highlighting
- Check-for-Understanding question
- NO answer shown yet
- Question focuses on strategy ("Why did I..."), not computation ("What is...")

**Reveal Slide**:
- Same visual as Ask slide
- Answer to CFU question
- Brief explanation of reasoning
- Visual stays in same position

**Number of Steps**: 2-3 maximum (4-6 slides total)

### Slide 7 (Optional): Reasoning/Pattern
**When to include**: Only if original problem asks "explain your reasoning"
**Purpose**: Make the implicit pattern explicit
**Content**:
- Pattern explanation in plain English
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Mathematical rule (optional)
- Key conceptual insight

### Slides 8-9: Independent Practice
**Purpose**: Test transfer without scaffolding
**Content**:
- New scenarios (different contexts)
- Same mathematical structure
- Zero step-by-step guidance
- Just problem setup

## The Four Rules

### Rule 1: The "Two-Slide" Rule
**Never show question and answer together**

Why: Forces students to mentally commit to a strategy before seeing if they're correct. Passive reading becomes active prediction.

### Rule 2: The "Visual Stability" Rule
**Keep main visual in same position across slides 2-6**

Why: Reduces cognitive load from visual searching. Mimics teacher at whiteboard who keeps problem visible while adding annotations.

Implementation:
- Fix position of table/diagram on slide 2
- Slides 3-6 maintain that exact position
- Add highlights, arrows, CFU boxes AROUND the stationary element
- Never reposition the core visual

### Rule 3: The "Real World" Rule
**Use engaging, age-appropriate contexts**

Why: Increases motivation and helps students see relevance.

Do:
- Gaming scenarios (RPG items, esports)
- Social media (views, followers, subscribers)
- STEM contexts (drones, coding, data)
- Sports and fitness

Don't:
- Generic "Person A and Person B"
- Boring textbook scenarios
- Abstract variables until reasoning slide

### Rule 4: The "Scaffolding Removal" Rule
**Maximum support → Zero support**

Why: Tests true understanding vs. pattern matching.

- Slides 2-6: Full scaffolding (highlighting, CFU, step-by-step)
- Slides 8-9: No scaffolding (just the raw problem)

## Check-for-Understanding (CFU) Question Patterns

### Good CFU Questions (Strategy-focused)
- "Why did I divide 6 by 2 instead of multiply?"
- "How did I know to remove the same amount from both sides?"
- "What operation undoes addition?"
- "How did I decide which step to do first?"

### Bad CFU Questions (Computation-focused)
- "What is 6 ÷ 2?" ❌
- "What's the answer?" ❌
- "How many are left?" ❌

**The difference**: Good questions ask about decision-making and strategy. Bad questions just ask for calculations.

## Visual Annotation Guidelines

### Minimal Text Principle
On Ask slides, let the visual do the talking:
- Highlight the relevant part
- Add arrows if needed
- Keep annotations simple
- Put the question in the CFU box at bottom

### Highlighting Techniques
- **Border/outline**: Circle or box around element
- **Background color**: Shade the row/cell
- **Arrows**: Point to specific parts (with small labels)
- **X-marks**: Cross out removed items

## Context Variety Across Problems

All three exit tickets must have:
- **Different surface details** (different scenarios, numbers)
- **Same deep structure** (same mathematical concept and steps)

Example:
1. Worked Example: RPG game item crafting
2. Practice 1: Sneaker-to-hoodie trade value
3. Practice 2: Gym weight plate comparison

All three involve hanger balance, but use completely different contexts.

## When to Use Different Visual Types

### HTML/CSS Tables
- Proportional relationships
- Data tables
- Simple numerical comparisons
- Static content

### P5.js Animations
- Hanger diagrams
- Balance problems
- Geometric transformations
- Shape manipulations
- Custom visualizations

### D3.js Visualizations
- Coordinate planes
- Graphs and plots
- Data visualizations
- Mathematical functions

## Why This Framework Works

**Research Support:**
- Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)
- Worked Example Effect (Atkinson et al., 2000)
- Self-Explanation Prompts (Chi et al., 1989)
- Transfer of Learning (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999)

**Practical Benefits:**
- Breaks overwhelming problems into digestible steps
- Forces active thinking vs. passive reading
- Builds conceptual understanding alongside procedural fluency
- Tests true learning through transfer problems

**Remember**: The structure is flexible (7-9 slides depending on problem complexity), but the principles are fixed: separate Ask from Reveal, maintain visual stability, use engaging contexts, remove scaffolding at the end.
