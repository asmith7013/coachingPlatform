# Analyze Problem Prompt

This prompt is used when analyzing a mastery check question image.
Both CLI and browser contexts use this same instruction set.

---

## CRITICAL: Understanding the Input

**The problem image is the MASTERY CHECK QUESTION** - the actual question students will answer on their exit ticket or assessment.

**Your job is to create a worked example that:**
1. Teaches the SAME mathematical skill
2. Uses the SAME strategy and steps
3. Uses DIFFERENT context and numbers than the mastery check

**Why different context?** Students should learn the strategy from the worked example, then apply it independently to the mastery check. If we use the same numbers/context, students can just copy the answer without learning.

---

## CRITICAL: Transcription First

**BEFORE doing any analysis, you MUST first transcribe EXACTLY what you see in the image.**

This includes:
- All text (problem statement, questions, instructions)
- All numbers and mathematical expressions
- Any diagrams, tables, or visual elements (describe them precisely)
- Answer choices if present
- Any labels, headers, or context provided

**Why this matters:** If the transcription is wrong, the entire analysis will be wrong. Take extra care to read ALL text, numbers, and visual elements accurately.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### STEP 1: Solve the Problem Yourself
- Work through the mastery check step-by-step
- Write out your complete solution
- Identify the final answer

### STEP 2: Identify Mathematical Structure
Be SPECIFIC, not vague:
- ✅ "solving two-step equations with variables on both sides"
- ❌ "algebra"

Ask yourself:
- What mathematical relationships are present?
- What prior knowledge does this assume?
- What format is the answer expected in?

### STEP 3: Identify What Makes This Challenging
- Where might students make mistakes?
- What's the key insight needed?
- What misconceptions does this address?

### STEP 4: Define ONE Clear Strategy
**This is critical. The strategy thread runs through ALL slides.**

**4a: Name the Strategy**
Give it a clear, memorable name:
- "Balance and Isolate"
- "Find the Unit Rate"
- "Plot and Connect"

**4b: State it in One Sentence**
Student-facing explanation:
- "To solve this, we [VERB] the [OBJECT] to find [GOAL]"

**4c: Identify 2-3 Moves (maximum 3)**
Each move: [Action verb] → [What it accomplishes]

**4d: Define Consistent Language**
These step verbs MUST:
- Be the EXACT same throughout all slides
- Appear on every slide header ("STEP 1: [VERB]")
- Be referenced in CFU questions

**4e: State the Big Idea**
One sentence that captures the core mathematical concept students will learn:
- "To solve equations, we keep both sides balanced"
- "Unit rates let us compare different quantities fairly"
- "Parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts"

The Big Idea is:
- More general than the one-sentence summary (strategy-agnostic)
- A mathematical truth/principle students can remember
- What ties together ALL the steps and scenarios

### STEP 5: Create Three Scenarios
**ALL must use DIFFERENT contexts from the mastery check:**

| Scenario | Purpose | Context Rule |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | Worked Example (full scaffolding) | DIFFERENT from mastery check |
| 2 | Practice (NO scaffolding) | DIFFERENT from mastery check AND Scenario 1 |
| 3 | Practice (NO scaffolding) | DIFFERENT from ALL above |

**DO:**
- Match context to grade level interests (gaming, social media, sports, STEM)
- Keep mathematical difficulty identical
- Give each scenario a visual anchor (icon/theme)

**DO NOT:**
- Use the same context as the mastery check
- Use the same numbers as the mastery check
- Change the problem type between scenarios

**IMPORTANT: Scenario Graph Plans**
If the problem requires a coordinate graph (`visualType: svg-visual`, `svgSubtype: coordinate-graph`), create a `graphPlan` for EACH scenario with that scenario's specific equations and values:
- Each scenario has different numbers, so each needs its own equations, scale, keyPoints, and annotations
- The graph structure (number of lines, annotation type) stays the same across scenarios
- Only the specific values change based on each scenario's numbers

Example: If Scenario 1 uses "y = 25x + 50" and Scenario 2 uses "y = 15x + 30", each scenario needs its own complete graphPlan with those specific equations, calculated endpoints, and appropriate scale.

### STEP 6: Determine Visual Type

**CRITICAL: ALL graphics/diagrams MUST use SVG.** The only exception is simple HTML tables.

- **text-only**: No graphics needed (rare - pure text/equation problems)
- **html-table**: Simple data tables with highlighting
- **svg-visual**: ALL other graphics - this includes:
  - Coordinate planes and graphs (svgSubtype: "coordinate-graph") → use `graph-planning.md`
  - **Non-graph diagrams** (svgSubtype: "diagram") → **use `reference/diagram-patterns.md` as PRIMARY REFERENCE**
    - Double number lines
    - Tape diagrams (bar models)
    - Hanger diagrams (balance equations)
    - Area models
    - Input-output tables
    - Ratio tables
  - Geometric shapes (svgSubtype: "shape")
  - Number lines and bar models (svgSubtype: "number-line")
  - Any custom visual (svgSubtype: "other")

**For non-graph SVGs:** READ `reference/diagram-patterns.md` to see the exact visual structure students expect from Illustrative Mathematics curriculum.

### STEP 7: SVG Planning (REQUIRED if Visual Type is "svg-visual")

**IF you selected "svg-visual" above, you MUST plan your SVG now.**

**For coordinate-graph subtype**, complete graph planning to ensure math is calculated BEFORE slide generation:

**7a: List Your Equations**
Write out every line/equation that will appear:
```
Line 1: y = [equation] (e.g., y = 5x)
Line 2: y = [equation] (e.g., y = 5x + 20)
```

**7b: Calculate Key Data Points (REQUIRED in graphPlan.keyPoints)**
For EACH line, calculate y at key x values. These MUST be included in the `keyPoints` array:
- Y-intercepts (where line crosses y-axis)
- Solution points (the answer to the problem)
- Any point specifically asked about in the problem
- Points used for slope triangles or annotations

Example:
```
Line 1: y = 5x
  - At x=0: y = 0 (y-intercept) → keyPoint: { label: "y-intercept Line 1", x: 0, y: 0 }
  - At x=4: y = 20 (solution) → keyPoint: { label: "solution", x: 4, y: 20 }

Line 2: y = 5x + 20
  - At x=0: y = 20 (y-intercept) → keyPoint: { label: "y-intercept Line 2", x: 0, y: 20 }
```

**CRITICAL:** Every important point that will be marked with a dot or label on the graph MUST appear in `keyPoints`.

**7c: Determine Scale (≤10 ticks on each axis)**
- X_MAX: rightmost x-value needed (common: 4, 5, 6, 8, 10)
  - X_MAX ≤6: count by 1s
  - X_MAX >6: count by 2s
- Y_MAX: use the scale tables in `graph-planning.md` to get exactly 9-10 ticks
  - Count by 1s up to Y_MAX=9
  - Count by 2s up to Y_MAX=18
  - Count by 4s up to Y_MAX=36
  - Count by 5s up to Y_MAX=45
  - See `graph-planning.md` for full table

**7d: Plan Annotations**
What mathematical relationship to show?
- Y-intercept shift (vertical arrow showing difference)
- Parallel lines (same slope label)
- Slope comparison
- Intersection point

**Include these calculated values in the graphPlan field of your output.**

### STEP 8: Generate Diagram Evolution Preview (REQUIRED for ALL worked examples)

**After planning the visual structure, create a step-by-step evolution showing how the diagram develops across slides.**

This is the most important preview for teachers - it shows EXACTLY how the visual will build from initial state through each step of the solution.

**8a: Create Initial State**
Show the diagram as it appears on the Problem Setup slide (Slide 3):
- For coordinate graphs: axes with scale labels, but no lines drawn yet
- For tape diagrams: the total bar with the unknown marked
- For hanger diagrams: the initial equation on the balance
- For number lines: the empty line with range marked

**8b: Create Step-by-Step Evolution**
For EACH strategy move, show:
1. The diagram state AFTER that step is completed (building cumulatively on previous steps)
2. What was added/changed from the previous state
3. Use ASCII art that matches the visual type

**8c: Match Steps to Strategy Moves**
The number of steps in diagramEvolution MUST match strategyDefinition.moves.length:
- 2 moves = 2 evolution steps
- 3 moves = 3 evolution steps

**Example for Coordinate Graph (2-line system of equations):**
```json
"diagramEvolution": {
  "initialState": "    y\n  50│\n    │\n  40│\n    │\n  30│\n    │\n  20│\n    │\n  10│\n    │\n   0└────┬────┬────┬────┬──── x\n        2    4    6    8",

      "changes": ["Mark intersection point at (5, 45)", "Highlight: This is where both equations are equal"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example for Tape Diagram (division problem):**
```json
"diagramEvolution": {
  "initialState": "Total: 24 stickers to share among 4 friends\n\n┌────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                 24                     │\n└────────────────────────────────────────┘",
