# Phase 2: Confirm & Plan

## Purpose
Present your analysis to the user, get their confirmation, and plan the three scenarios - all using DIFFERENT contexts from the mastery check.

## Output Format: PPTX-Compatible HTML
All slides will be **PPTX-compatible HTML** (960×540px, light theme, 9 slides). See `03-generate-slides/02-technical-rules.md` for technical specs.

## Prerequisites
- Phase 1 complete
- You have completed PROBLEM ANALYSIS template
- You have completed STRATEGY DEFINITION template

---

## REMINDER: Context Separation

The user provided a **mastery check question**. ALL scenarios you create must use **different contexts and numbers** from that question:

| What | Context |
|------|---------|
| Mastery Check (user's input) | The ACTUAL question students will answer |
| Scenario 1 (Worked Example) | DIFFERENT context - teaches the strategy |
| Scenario 2 (Practice) | DIFFERENT context - first practice |
| Scenario 3 (Practice) | DIFFERENT context - second practice |

**Students will see:** Worked Example → Practice 1 → Practice 2 → (then later) Mastery Check

---

## Step 2.1: Present Analysis to User

**Show the user your understanding and WAIT for confirmation.**

Use this exact template:

```
Based on the mastery check question you provided, here's my understanding:

**Problem Type:** [from PROBLEM ANALYSIS]
**Strategy I'll Use:** [strategy name from STRATEGY DEFINITION]
**One-Sentence Summary:** [from STRATEGY DEFINITION]

**Visual Type:** [from Visual Types table]
**Visual Plan:** [key details for this visual - see VisualPlan schemas]
  - [field 1]: [value]
  - [field 2]: [value]
  - [field 3]: [value, if applicable]

**The Steps:**
1. [STEP VERB]: [brief description]
2. [STEP VERB]: [brief description]
3. [STEP VERB]: [brief description, if needed]

**The three scenarios (all DIFFERENT from the mastery check):**
- Scenario 1 (worked example): [context + what makes it engaging]
- Scenario 2 (practice): [different context]
- Scenario 3 (practice): [different context]

Note: These scenarios all teach the same skill as your mastery check but use different numbers and contexts, so students learn the strategy without seeing the actual answer.
```

### ⚠️ REQUIRED: Include Diagram Preview

**Include the Diagram Preview you created in Phase 1.** This shows the user the visual structure for confirmation.

The preview was already generated in Phase 1 using `reference/diagram-patterns.md` as a guide. Present it here so the user can confirm the visual structure is correct before proceeding.

**Example:**
```
**Diagram Preview (Scenario 1 - Chicken Nuggets):**

┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│   ?    │   6    │   6    │   6    │   6    │  = 30
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘

Key elements:
- Unknown (?) at start: number of students
- Each box: 6 nuggets per student
- Total: 30 nuggets

Does this visual structure look right?
```

**Then ask for confirmation:**

```
Does this match what you're looking for? Should I proceed or adjust anything?
```

---

## Step 2.2: WAIT for User Confirmation

**STOP HERE. Do not proceed until the user responds.**

The user might:
- **Confirm** ("yes", "proceed", "looks good") → Continue to Step 2.3
- **Request changes** → Adjust your analysis/strategy and re-present
- **Ask questions** → Answer them, then re-confirm

**Do NOT generate slides until the user explicitly confirms.**

---

## Visual Types

**Choose ONE visual type that best represents the math:**

| Visual Type | Use For | Key Details to Plan |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| `tape-diagram` | Division, multiplication, part-whole | boxes, values per box, total, unknown position |
| `coordinate-graph` | Linear equations, rates, proportions | equations, scale, keyPoints, annotations |
| `double-number-line` | Ratios, unit rates, percentages | quantity A values, quantity B values, alignment |
| `area-model` | Multiplication, distributive property | dimensions, partial products |
| `number-line` | Integers, inequalities, operations | range, marked points, arrows |
| `ratio-table` | Equivalent ratios, scaling | column values, scale factors |
| `hanger-diagram` | Equation solving, balance | left side, right side, shapes |
| `input-output-table` | Functions, patterns, rules | input values, output values, rule |
| `grid-diagram` | Area by counting, decomposing shapes | rows, cols, shaded regions, unit label |
| `net-diagram` | Surface area, 3D→2D unfolding | shape type, faces with dimensions, fold lines |
| `measurement-diagram` | Base & height, labeled dimensions | shape type, labeled measurements, right angle indicators |
| `discrete-diagram` | Objects in groups, discrete ratios | groups, items per group, total, visual type |
| `base-ten-diagram` | Place value, decimal operations | ones, tens, hundreds blocks, operation |
| `dot-plot` | Data distributions, frequencies | data points, axis range, label |
| `box-plot` | Quartiles, variability, outliers | min, Q1, median, Q3, max, outliers |
| `bar-graph` | Comparing frequencies, categories | categories, values, orientation |
| `tree-diagram` | Probability, sample spaces | branches, probabilities, outcomes |
| `circle-diagram` | Circles with labeled parts | radius, diameter, circumference, center point |
| `scale-drawing` | Maps, floor plans, blueprints | scale factor, actual/drawing measurements |
| `scaled-figures` | Original vs copy comparison | original dims, scale factor, copy dims |
| `other` | Custom diagrams not listed above | describe visual structure and key elements |

**Visual selection happens ONCE in analysis, then applies to ALL scenarios.**

---

## Step 2.3: Generate Scenarios (All Different from Mastery Check)

**Only after user confirms**, finalize the three scenarios.

### Critical: Context Separation

**NONE of the scenarios should use the same context or numbers as the mastery check question the user provided.**

The mastery check is what students will answer AFTER completing the worked example and practice. Your scenarios prepare them for it without giving away the answer.

### Scenario Requirements

Each scenario MUST:
- Use the **exact same mathematical structure** as the mastery check
- Require the **exact same strategy** to solve
- Use **DIFFERENT numbers and context** from the mastery check (and from each other)
- Be solvable using the **exact same steps in the exact same order**
- Include a **condensed problem reminder (≤15 words)** for use on slides 2-8

### ⚠️ Visual Progression: Plan What Changes Each Step (REQUIRED for Scenario 1)

**For the worked example (Scenario 1), you MUST define what the visual shows at each step.**

The visual should tell a story that builds toward the answer. Each step adds something new.

**Format:** For each step, describe what gets ADDED or HIGHLIGHTED on the visual.

```
Visual Progression (Scenario 1):
- Setup (Slide 2): [What the visual shows initially - problem state, unknowns visible]
- Step 1 (Slides 3-4): [What gets highlighted/added after Step 1]
- Step 2 (Slides 5-6): [What gets highlighted/added after Step 2]
- Step 3 (Slides 7-8): [What shows the final answer on the visual]
```

**Examples by Visual Type:**

| Visual Type | Setup Shows | Step 1 Adds | Step 2 Adds | Step 3 Adds |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Tape diagram | Empty tape with ? and total | Boxes with value per box | Highlight the count | Answer label |
| Coordinate graph | Blank axes with labels | First line plotted | Second line plotted | Intersection labeled |
| Hanger diagram | Initial balanced equation | Subtraction from both sides | Division both sides | Variable isolated |
| Double number line | Two lines with known values | Unit rate marked | Scale factor applied | Unknown value found |

### ⚠️ Conciseness: Define Problem Reminders NOW

For each scenario, create the **condensed problem reminder** that will appear on slides.

**Format:** Short phrases, not full sentences. Max 15 words.

```
✅ GOOD: "30 nuggets total. 6 per student. How many students?"
✅ GOOD: "Drone: 150m in 30 sec. Find the speed."
❌ BAD:  "A large box has 30 chicken nuggets. If each student gets 6 nuggets, how many students can have a snack?"
```

### Scenario Design Principles

**DO:**
- Match context to grade level interests (gaming, social media, sports, etc.)
- Keep mathematical difficulty identical to mastery check
- Ensure the same moves apply in the same order
- Use engaging, real-world situations
- Give each scenario a visual anchor (icon/theme)
- **Verify each scenario is clearly different from the mastery check**

**DO NOT:**
- Use the same context as the mastery check question
- Use the same numbers as the mastery check question
- Change the problem type
- Add or remove steps from the solution
- Introduce new mathematical concepts
- Create scenarios requiring a different strategy

### Output Template:

```

## Step 2.4: Update Progress File

After user confirms and scenarios are defined, update the progress file:

**File:** `src/app/presentations/{slug}/.worked-example-progress.json`

Update these fields:
```json
{
  "phase": 2,
  "phaseName": "Confirm & Plan",
  "userConfirmed": true,
  "scenarios": ["[Scenario 1 name]", "[Scenario 2 name]", "[Scenario 3 name]"],
  "totalSlides": [estimated count: 14-16],
  "updatedAt": "[ISO timestamp]"
}
```

Use the Read tool to read the current file, then use Edit to update only the changed fields.

---
