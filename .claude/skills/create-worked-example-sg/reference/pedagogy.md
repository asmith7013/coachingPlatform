# Pedagogical Framework for Worked Example Slide Decks

This document explains the research-based framework behind the slide structure.

## PPTX Format: Static Slides with Animation

**IMPORTANT**: Slides are designed for PPTX export (PowerPoint/Google Slides).
- No JavaScript toggles or animations in HTML
- CFU and Answer boxes use PPTX animation (appear on click)
- Both CFU and Answer are on the SAME slide (Answer overlays CFU on second click)
- Total slide count: **7 slides** (6 worked example + 1 printable with practice problems)

## Core Principles

### 1. Cognitive Load Theory
Breaking complex problems into micro-steps prevents cognitive overload. Students can focus on one decision point at a time.

### 2. Active Prediction Pedagogy
Separating questions from answers forces mental commitment before revealing solutions. This active engagement improves retention. In PPTX format, this means advancing to the next slide to see the answer.

### 3. Transfer of Learning
Independent practice (practice slides) tests whether students can apply logic to new contexts without scaffolding.

## Slide Structure (7 Slides)

### Slide 1: Teacher Instructions
**Purpose**: Provide teacher with lesson overview (not shown to students)
**Content**:
- Big Idea (core mathematical concept)
- Learning Targets
- Strategy overview (name + summary)
- Visually quiet, informational design

### Slide 2: Big Idea
**Purpose**: Introduce the core concept to students
**Content**:
- Grade/Unit/Lesson prominently displayed
- "BIG IDEA" badge
- Big Idea statement (large, centered)
- Clean, student-facing design with gradient background

### Slide 3: Problem Setup (Scenario 1)
**Purpose**: Provide context and show complete problem
**Content**:
- Engaging scenario with theme icon
- Problem statement
- Visual representation (graph, table, diagram)
- No solution yet

### Slides 4-6: Step-by-Step with CFU + Answer (Stacked)

**Each step is ONE slide with both CFU and Answer boxes (animated):**

**Step N Slide** (e.g., Slide 4):
- Step badge: "STEP 1"
- Title: The action question (e.g., "IDENTIFY the slope and y-intercept")
- Visual with result highlighted/annotated
- Problem reminder at bottom left corner
- CFU box (appears on FIRST click)
- Answer box (appears on SECOND click, overlays CFU)

**Number of Steps**: 3 steps = 3 slides

### Slide 7: Printable Worksheet (Final Slide)
**Purpose**: Provide take-home practice
**Content**:
- ALL practice problems (Scenarios 2 and 3) in ONE slide with multiple print-page divs
- White background, black text (for printing)
- Times New Roman font
- 8.5in × 11in page format
- @media print CSS
- NO strategy reminders - students apply independently
- Generated separately after slides 1-6 complete

## The Five Rules

### Rule 1: The "Click-to-Reveal" Rule
**CFU and Answer appear on click, in sequence**

Why: Forces students to mentally commit to a strategy before seeing if they're correct. Passive reading becomes active prediction.

PPTX Implementation:
- CFU box appears on FIRST click
- Answer box appears on SECOND click (overlays CFU)
- Teacher can pause, discuss, then reveal each

### Rule 2: The "Visual Stability" Rule
**Keep main visual in same position across slides 3-6**

Why: Reduces cognitive load from visual searching. Mimics teacher at whiteboard who keeps problem visible while adding annotations.

Implementation:
- Fix position of graph/table on slide 2
- Slides 3-8 maintain that exact position
- Add highlights, arrows, annotations AROUND the stationary element
- Never reposition the core visual between slides

#### Sub-Principle: Progressive Visual Revelation

**"Stability" means POSITION is fixed, but CONTENT evolves.**

Each step slide must ADD something new to the visual. If slides 3-8 show identical visuals, students see repetition instead of progression. The visual should tell a story that builds toward the answer.

**The Pattern:**
```
Slide 2 (Setup):    Visual shows the PROBLEM (unknowns visible)
Slide 3-4 (Step 1): Visual shows Step 1 RESULT highlighted
Slide 5-6 (Step 2): Visual shows Step 2 RESULT added
Slide 7-8 (Step 3): Visual shows SOLUTION complete
```

**What Changes vs. What Stays:**

| Stays Fixed | Changes Each Step |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Visual position (x, y coordinates) | Highlighted elements |
| Overall dimensions and scale | Annotations and labels |
| Base structure (axes, boxes, shapes) | Revealed values |
| Color scheme | Which parts are emphasized |

**Examples by Visual Type:**

| Visual Type | Step 1 Shows | Step 2 Shows | Step 3 Shows |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Tape diagram** | Unknown (?) and total | Boxes divided with values | Answer (box count) revealed |
| **Coordinate graph** | Blank axes with scale | First line/point plotted | Second line, intersection labeled |
| **Hanger diagram** | Initial equation on balance | One side simplified | Solution isolated |
| **Double number line** | Both lines with some values | Unit rate marked | Unknown value found |
| **Area model** | Dimensions labeled | Partial products filled | Total computed |
| **Input-output table** | Some inputs/outputs | Pattern identified | Missing value filled |

**Anti-Pattern (WRONG):**
```
Slide 2: Shows "Two Possible Meanings" panel
Slide 3: Shows SAME "Two Possible Meanings" panel  ❌ REPETITION
Slide 4: Shows SAME "Two Possible Meanings" panel  ❌ REPETITION
```

**Correct Pattern:**
```
Slide 2: Shows problem setup (unknown visible)
Slide 3: Shows Step 1 interpretation HIGHLIGHTED
Slide 4: Shows Step 1 result with values FILLED IN
Slide 5: Shows Step 2 operation on the visual
...and so on, building toward the answer
```

### Rule 3: The "Real World" Rule
**Use engaging, age-appropriate contexts**

Why: Increases motivation and helps students see relevance.

Do:
- Gaming scenarios (RPG items, esports, gaming earnings)
- Social media (views, followers, subscribers)
- STEM contexts (drones, coding, data science)
- Sports and fitness (training plans, game stats)

Don't:
- Generic "Person A and Person B"
- Boring textbook scenarios
- Abstract variables until reasoning slide

### Rule 4: The "Scaffolding Removal" Rule
**Maximum support → Zero support**

Why: Tests true understanding vs. pattern matching.

- Slides 3-6: Full scaffolding (step badges, CFU questions, highlighting)
- Slide 7 (Printable): No scaffolding (just the raw problems + "Your Task")

### Rule 5: The "3-Second Scan" Rule
**A student should understand the key point in 3 seconds**

Why: Every extra word competes with the math for attention. If a student can't grasp the slide's purpose in 3 seconds, it's too cluttered.

**Text Limits (STRICTLY ENFORCED):**

| Element | Max Words | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Problem reminder | 15 words | "30 nuggets total. 6 per student. How many students?" |
| Step subtitle | 0 words | NO explanatory subtitles - remove entirely |
| CFU question | 12 words | "Why did I put the '?' at the beginning?" |
| Answer explanation | 25 words | 1-2 short sentences max |

**Complementary Columns (NO DUPLICATION):**

```
LEFT COLUMN              RIGHT COLUMN
─────────────            ─────────────
Text explanation    →    Visual representation
Prose & equations        Diagrams, tables, graphs
"What we're doing"       "What it looks like"

⚠️ NEVER repeat the same content in both columns
```

- **Left column**: Problem statement, step explanation, equations as text
- **Right column**: Visual ONLY - diagram, graph, table, tape diagram
- **No text boxes inside visuals** that repeat left-side content
- **Labels on visuals**: Only minimal labels (numbers, variable names) - NOT explanatory sentences

**What to REMOVE:**
- ❌ "First, let's figure out..." (explanatory subtitles)
- ❌ "Reading the graph: At point (6,12)..." (redundant info boxes)
- ❌ Two-part CFU questions ("What is X? How did you calculate it?")
- ❌ Extra context in answers ("This is also called the constant of proportionality!")

**What to KEEP:**
- ✅ Large, prominent main content (36-48px in columns)
- ✅ Ultra-condensed problem reminders
- ✅ Single-purpose slides (each slide adds ONE concept)
- ✅ Visual diagrams that complement (not duplicate) the text

## Step Naming and Strategy Thread

**CRITICAL**: The strategy must be consistent throughout ALL slides.

### Strategy Definition
Before generating slides, define:
1. **Strategy Name**: Clear, memorable (e.g., "Plot and Connect", "Balance and Isolate")
2. **One-Sentence Summary**: "To solve this, we [VERB] the [OBJECT] to find [GOAL]"
3. **2-3 Moves**: Each move is a verb + what it accomplishes

### Step Headers Use Strategy Verbs
If your moves are IDENTIFY, PLOT, CONNECT:
- Slide 3-4: "STEP 1: IDENTIFY"
- Slide 5-6: "STEP 2: PLOT"
- Slide 7-8: "STEP 3: CONNECT"

### CFU Questions Reference Strategy
- ✅ "Why did I IDENTIFY the slope first?"
- ✅ "How does PLOTTING the y-intercept help me?"
- ❌ "What is 2 times 3?" (computation, not strategy)

## Check-for-Understanding (CFU) Question Patterns

### CFU Format Rules (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
- **ONE question only** - never two-part questions
- **12 words max** - if longer, it's too complex
- **Strategy-focused** - ask about WHY, not WHAT

### Good CFU Questions (Strategy-focused, ≤12 words)
- "Why did I [VERB] first?" ✅ (6 words)
- "How did I know to [VERB] here?" ✅ (8 words)
- "Why is the '?' at the beginning?" ✅ (7 words)
- "How does [VERB]ing help me find the answer?" ✅ (9 words)

### Bad CFU Questions
- "What is 6 ÷ 2?" ❌ (computation, not strategy)
- "What's the answer?" ❌ (result-focused)
- "What is turtle g's speed? How did you calculate it?" ❌ (TWO questions!)
- "Why did I subtract 4 from both sides instead of dividing first?" ❌ (17 words - too long!)

**The difference**: Good questions are SHORT, ask about decision-making and strategy. Bad questions ask for calculations or are too wordy.

## Visual Annotation Guidelines

### Graph/SVG Constraints (PPTX-Compatible)
- Use viewBox for consistent scaling
- Fixed container dimensions (560×360px typical)
- Explicit width/height on SVG element
- Center in container using layout classes

### Highlighting Techniques
- **Border/outline**: Circle or box around element
- **Background color**: Shade the relevant area
- **Arrows**: Point to specific parts (with small labels)
- **Color coding**: Consistent colors for slope/intercept/points

### Coordinate Mapping (CRITICAL for Graph Alignment)
- Calculate pixels per unit consistently
- Formula: `pixelX = marginLeft + (x - xMin) * pixelsPerUnit`
- Keep margins consistent across all graph slides
- Points MUST land exactly on grid intersections

## Context Variety Across Scenarios

All three scenarios must have:
- **Different surface details** (different contexts, numbers)
- **Same deep structure** (same mathematical concept and strategy)
- **Same difficulty level** (don't make practice easier)

Example for Graphing Linear Equations:
1. Scenario 1 (Worked): Gaming earnings ($50 base + $15/stream)
2. Scenario 2 (Practice): Drone altitude (100ft start + 25ft/min)
3. Scenario 3 (Practice): Savings growth ($200 start + $75/week)

All three use y = mx + b, but with completely different contexts.

## Visual Type Selection

### SVG Graphics (Recommended for PPTX)
- Coordinate planes and graphs
- Geometric shapes
- Tables with highlighting
- Custom diagrams

### When to Use HTML Tables
- Data comparisons
- Proportional relationships
- Simple numerical displays

### Avoid for PPTX
- JavaScript animations
- Interactive elements
- Canvas-based graphics (use SVG instead)

## Why This Framework Works

**Research Support:**
- Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)
- Worked Example Effect (Atkinson et al., 2000)
- Self-Explanation Prompts (Chi et al., 1989)
- Transfer of Learning (Bransford & Schwartz, 1999)

**Practical Benefits:**
