### Task 1.2: Three-Zone Time Slot Component - CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED ✅
**Priority:** CRITICAL | **Effort:** Small | **Status:** COMPLETED

**Description:** ~~Implement three-zone time slot interaction system with split layout design~~ 
**UPDATED:** ✅ Fixed visual balance and removed unwanted functionality from completed component

**CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED:**

#### ✅ Fix 1: Visual Balance (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Left column (First Half + Second Half) visually dominated right column (Full Period)
- **Solution**: ✅ Implemented 2:3 ratio (40%:60%) for balanced visual weight
- **Code Change**: ✅ Updated `leftColumn` and `rightColumn` Tailwind classes

```typescript
// Fixed (balanced):
leftColumn: 'flex flex-col w-2/5 border-r border-gray-200'  // 40%
rightColumn: 'w-3/5 flex items-center justify-center'       // 60%
```

#### ✅ Fix 2: Remove Teacher Assignment Display (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Teacher names appeared in zones, causing layout shifts
- **Solution**: ✅ Removed assignment prop and all teacher name rendering
- **Reason**: Teacher selection happens at higher level (blue dropdown in workflow)

#### ✅ Fix 3: Simplify Component Interface (COMPLETED)
- **Remove**: ✅ `assignment` prop entirely removed
- **Remove**: ✅ Teacher name rendering logic removed
- **Remove**: ✅ Assignment ring styling removed
- **Keep**: ✅ Core zone selection functionality maintained

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `src/components/core/interactive/ThreeZoneTimeSlot.tsx` - Visual ratio fixed and assignment prop removed
- ✅ `src/app/dev/three-zone-demo/page.tsx` - Demo updated to remove assignment props

**Additional Fixes Completed:**
- ✅ `src/components/core/interactive/ThreeZoneTimeSlot.tsx` - Full Period zone height fix: changed rightColumn to 'w-3/5 flex' and fullZone to use 'flex-1' for proper space expansion

**Updated Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] ✅ **CRITICAL**: Left and right columns have balanced visual weight (2:3 ratio)
- [x] ✅ **HIGH**: No teacher names display within zones
- [x] ✅ Component interface simplified to essential props only
- [x] ✅ Zone selection works in Master Schedule workflow
- [x] ✅ No layout shifts during interaction
- [x] ✅ **BONUS**: Full Period zone properly fills available height for perfect visual balance
