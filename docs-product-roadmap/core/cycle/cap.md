## 1. Coaching Action Plan Workflow and Interface

**Status:** PLANNED  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Large  
**Business Value:** High

### Core Definition
**Problem:** Current coaching action plan process is inefficient, making it difficult to edit plans, view backend data, and integrate with visit scheduling and observation workflows.

**Solution:** Digital workflow interface that allows coaches to efficiently create, edit, and manage coaching action plans with automatic data population from visits and seamless integration with note-taking during observations.

### Requirements Overview
- Must allow coaches to create action plans either before or after first visit
- Must support non-linear editing (work on different sections simultaneously)
- Must automatically populate visit dates from scheduling system
- Must provide quick access to relevant plan sections during observations
- Must allow plan extension with additional visits
- Must be viewable by teachers (read-only initially)
- Must integrate tightly with visit scheduling system

### Data Requirements
**Schema Integration:**
- Leverage existing CoachingActionPlanZodSchema structure
- Auto-populate from Visit entities and scheduling data
- Support dynamic visit addition and date updates

**Auto-Population Rules:**
- Import teacher and school data from profiles
- Pull visit dates from scheduling system
- Pre-fill cycle structure based on standard 3-cycle format
- Suggest IPG focus areas based on previous assessments

### UI/UX Considerations
**Key Interactions:**
- Form-based creation wizard with progress indicators
- Section-based editing (needs assessment, goals, weekly plans, implementation records)
- Quick-access sidebar during visits showing relevant plan elements
- Inline editing for visit extensions and plan modifications

**Component Strategy:**
- Multi-step form component for plan creation
- Collapsible sections for plan editing
- Quick-reference overlay for observation access
- Integration with existing ResourceForm patterns

### User Journey
**Plan Creation Flow:**
1. Coach identifies need (before/after first visit)
2. Creates plan using guided workflow
3. System auto-populates teacher/school data
4. Coach defines IPG focus and rationale
5. Sets goals with teacher/student outcomes
6. System generates visit schedule template
7. Coach customizes visit focuses and actions

**Plan Management Flow:**
1. Coach accesses existing plans from dashboard
2. Reviews and updates before each visit
3. During observation, quick-accesses relevant plan sections
4. Post-visit, updates implementation records
5. Extends plan with additional visits as needed

### Technical Architecture
**Dependencies:**
- Existing CoachingActionPlan and Visit schemas
- Visit scheduling system integration
- Teacher and school profile systems

**Implementation Approach:**
- Multi-step form wizard using existing form patterns
- Real-time auto-save for plan sections
- API endpoints for plan CRUD operations
- Quick-access modal/overlay for observation integration

### Success Metrics
- Reduce plan creation time by 50%
- Increase plan edit/adoption rate
- Enable quick access to plan elements during observations (< 3 seconds)
- Measure coach workflow efficiency through plan completion rates

### Dependencies
**Requires:** Visit scheduling system, Teacher profiles, School profiles
**Enables:** Enhanced note-taking during observations, Plan-driven visit workflows

### Open Questions
- What specific data fields should auto-populate from previous visits/assessments?
- How should the quick-access interface appear during observations (modal, sidebar, overlay)?
- Should there be templates for common IPG focus areas to speed creation?
- How should plan versioning work when extending or modifying existing plans?
