- `src/components/features/coaching/stages/CAPStage3.tsx` - ✅ NO CHANGES NEEDED: Already properly structured using ImplementationRecordCard  
- `src/components/features/coaching/stages/CAPStage4.tsx` - ✅ COMPLETED: Replaced 200+ lines of custom evidence management logic with EvidenceManager and ArrayFieldManager (714→497 lines, 30% reduction)

**Files to Modify (Remaining):**
- `src/components/features/coaching/CoachingActionPlanDashboard.tsx` - UPDATE: Use domain components and simplified hooks
- `src/components/features/coaching/CoachingActionPlanDetailedEditor.tsx` - UPDATE: Use schema-driven forms  
- `src/components/features/coaching/stages/CAPStage1.tsx` - UPDATE: Use ActionPlanStageForm component

**Files to Delete:**
- `src/components/features/coaching/hooks/useCoachingActionPlans.ts` - REASON: Replaced by simplified domain hook
- Complex custom form logic in stage components - REASON: Replaced by schema-driven forms
