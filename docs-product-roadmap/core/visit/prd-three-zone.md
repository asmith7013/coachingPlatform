# Product Requirements Document: Three-Zone Visit Scheduling

## Introduction/Overview

The Three-Zone Visit Scheduling feature enables coaches to quickly and efficiently schedule coaching visits within existing school periods using a flexible time-slot system. Instead of scheduling entire periods, coaches can select specific portions of a period (first half, second half, or full period) to optimize their visit schedules and accommodate multiple activities within the same time block.

This feature addresses the current challenge of time-consuming visit scheduling by providing an intuitive, click-to-schedule interface with Google Docs-style autosave functionality that immediately updates the coach's daily schedule and notifies relevant teachers.

**Goal:** Streamline the coaching visit scheduling process to enable faster, more flexible daily schedule creation that can be easily shared, accessed, and modified throughout the coaching day.

## Goals

1. **Efficiency:** Reduce visit scheduling time by 75% through intuitive click-to-schedule interface
2. **Flexibility:** Enable coaches to schedule partial-period visits (25-minute segments instead of full 45-minute periods)
3. **Transparency:** Provide real-time schedule updates to teachers and organizational stakeholders
4. **Accessibility:** Create exportable, easily accessible schedules for use during visits and organizational review
5. **Reliability:** Implement autosave functionality to prevent schedule loss and enable real-time collaboration

## User Stories

1. **As a coach**, I want to schedule a 25-minute observation during the first half of Period 2 so that I can visit a different teacher during the second half of the same period, maximizing my daily coverage.

2. **As a coach**, I want to schedule both an observation and debrief with the same teacher during their prep period so that I can efficiently complete a full coaching cycle in one time slot.

3. **As a coach**, I want to quickly select multiple teachers for the same time slot so that I can schedule collaborative observations or team meetings.

4. **As a teacher**, I want to receive automatic notifications about scheduled visits so that I can prepare appropriately and know when to expect coaching interactions.

5. **As an administrator**, I want to view and export coaching schedules so that I can understand coaching coverage and provide context for school visits.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Scheduling Functionality
1. The system must display existing visits in a schedule grid format with teacher columns and period rows
2. The system must allow coaches to click on any teacher-period intersection to initiate scheduling
3. The system must present three time-zone options: First Half, Second Half, and Full Period
4. The system must display calculated time ranges for each zone (e.g., "8:00-8:22" for first half of an 8:00-8:45 period)
5. The system must support selection of up to two teachers simultaneously for the same time slot
6. The system must prevent more than two overlapping assignments in the same time period

### Data Capture and Storage
7. The system must capture and store: teacher ID, selected time slot, visit purpose, coach ID, and scheduling timestamp
8. The system must automatically save selections to the database without requiring manual save actions
9. The system must maintain a persistent record of all scheduled visits for historical tracking

### Schedule Display and Management
10. The system must display scheduled visits in a "Planned Visits" sidebar with real-time updates
11. The system must show scheduled visits in the main grid with visual indicators (colored blocks, teacher names)
12. The system must generate a comprehensive visit summary accessible during, throughout, and after the coaching day
13. The system must allow real-time modifications to existing scheduled visits
14. The system must support schedule export functionality for sharing with stakeholders

### User Interface Requirements
15. The system must use the existing ThreeZoneTimeSlot component for time selection
16. The system must provide immediate visual feedback when teachers/time slots are selected
17. The system must display clear time boundaries and period labels for each selection
18. The system must show teacher names and any assigned purposes for scheduled slots

### Integration Requirements
19. The system must integrate with the existing visit management system to only allow scheduling on pre-approved visit days
20. The system must work within the established bell schedule framework without modifying period times
21. The system must connect to the notification system to alert teachers of scheduled visits

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Bell Schedule Modification:** This feature will not allow editing of school bell schedules or period timing
2. **Visit Approval Workflow:** Scheduled visits will not require additional approval steps - they are immediately active
3. **Cross-School Scheduling:** This feature will not support scheduling visits across multiple schools simultaneously
4. **Historical Schedule Analytics:** Advanced analytics on scheduling patterns are not included in this iteration
5. **Mobile-Specific UI:** While mobile-responsive, this will not include mobile-specific scheduling interfaces
6. **Integration with External Calendar Systems:** Direct integration with Google Calendar, Outlook, etc. is not included

## Design Considerations

- **Existing Component Usage:** Leverage the current `ThreeZoneTimeSlot` component located at `src/components/features/scheduling/ThreeZoneTimeSlot.tsx`
- **Visual Consistency:** Follow established color coding system (blue for first half, purple for second half, green for full period)
- **Grid Integration:** Build upon the existing `ScheduleGrid` and `ScheduleCell` components
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure functionality works on tablets and desktop devices used during coaching visits
- **Accessibility:** Maintain keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for inclusive use

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Integration with existing `ScheduleGrid`, `ScheduleCell`, and `ThreeZoneTimeSlot` components
- Database schema updates to support time-zone-specific visit scheduling
- Real-time update mechanism (possibly WebSocket or polling) for live schedule synchronization

### Data Model Updates
- Extend visit scheduling schema to include `timeSlotType` (first_half, second_half, full_period)
- Add `startTime` and `endTime` fields for precise time tracking
- Include `conflictingVisits` array for multiple-teacher assignments

### Performance Considerations
- Implement efficient caching for schedule data to support real-time updates
- Consider database indexing for quick teacher-period-time queries
- Optimize for concurrent editing by multiple coaches

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Scheduling Time Reduction:** Achieve 75% reduction in time required to create daily visit schedules
- **User Adoption:** 90% of coaches actively using the feature within 4 weeks of deployment
- **Schedule Completion Rate:** 95% of coaching days have complete schedules created using this feature

### Quality Metrics
- **Schedule Accuracy:** Less than 5% of scheduled visits require modifications on the day of coaching
- **Teacher Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from 85% of teachers regarding visit predictability and communication
- **System Reliability:** 99.5% uptime for scheduling functionality with successful autosave rate above 99%

### Business Impact
- **Visit Coverage:** 20% increase in daily visit capacity through efficient time slot utilization
- **Schedule Export Usage:** 70% of completed schedules are exported and shared with stakeholders
- **Conflict Reduction:** 50% reduction in scheduling conflicts requiring manual resolution

## Open Questions

1. **Notification Timing:** When should teachers receive notifications about scheduled visits? Immediately upon scheduling, or at a designated time before the visit?

2. **Schedule Modification Permissions:** Should there be time-based restrictions on when coaches can modify schedules (e.g., no changes within 2 hours of visit time)?

3. **Conflict Resolution:** What should happen if a coach tries to schedule beyond the two-teacher limit? Should the system suggest alternative times or require manual override?

4. **Purpose Field Requirements:** Should visit purpose be required for all scheduled slots, or optional with default values?

5. **Archive/History:** How long should completed visit schedules be retained in the system for historical reference?

6. **Integration Priority:** Should this feature integrate with the Monday.com system mentioned in the project documentation, and if so, what would that integration look like?

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Core scheduling with three-zone selection, autosave, and basic display
**Phase 2:** Advanced features like conflict management, export functionality, and notification system
**Phase 3:** Integration enhancements and analytics capabilities
