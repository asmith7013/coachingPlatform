        question: "What strategies have been most effective in improving student comprehension?",
        response: "The explicit teaching of annotation techniques and the restructuring of guided reading groups based on specific skill needs have shown the most impact. Students are now more actively engaged with texts and are developing stronger metacognitive awareness during reading."
      },
      {
        question: "What adjustments would improve implementation in the next phase?",
        response: "We need to focus more on transferring these skills to independent reading contexts. Creating opportunities for students to apply close reading strategies during independent reading time with appropriate scaffolding will be key in the next phase."
      },
      {
        question: "How has this coaching cycle impacted your teaching practice?",
