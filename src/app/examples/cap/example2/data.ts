  // Stage 1: Identify Needs & Determine Focus
  focus: "Core Action 2.B",
  rationale: "Based on the initial walkthrough, students have limited opportunities to engage with rigorous tasks that require mathematical reasoning. Most observed tasks were procedural with single correct answers rather than tasks requiring deeper thinking or multiple approaches.",
  
  // Stage 2: Set Goals
  goalSet: "By the end of the coaching cycle, the teacher will consistently implement tasks that require students to engage in productive struggle with grade-level mathematics concepts. As a result, students will demonstrate increased perseverance and articulate their mathematical reasoning. This will be evidenced by student work samples, classroom discourse observations, and exit ticket responses.",
  teacherOutcome: "Teacher will select and implement tasks requiring multiple approaches and student reasoning in at least 80% of observed lessons, up from current 30%.",
  studentOutcome: "Student engagement in mathematical discourse will increase from an average of 40% participation to 75% participation as measured by classroom observation data.",
  
  // Stage 3: Planning Implementation and Support
  actionSteps: "The coach will support the teacher in selecting and implementing rigorous mathematical tasks, facilitate reflection on student responses, and provide resources for scaffolding productive struggle.",
