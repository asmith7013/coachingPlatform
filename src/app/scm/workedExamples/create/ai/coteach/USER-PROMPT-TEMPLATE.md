## What You'll Get

The AI will:

1. **Show a complete analysis** — problem type, strategy, 3 scenarios (all with different contexts from the mastery check), and diagram evolution showing how the visual builds across slides.

2. **Generate 10 HTML slides:**

| Slide | Type                    | Description                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Teacher Instructions    | Big Idea, Learning Targets, Strategy (teacher-facing)   |
| 2     | Big Idea                | Grade/Unit/Lesson + Big Idea statement (student-facing) |
| 3     | Problem Setup           | Scenario 1 introduction with visual                     |
| 4-6   | Step 1-3 + CFU + Answer | Strategy steps with Check for Understanding             |
| 7     | Practice Preview 1      | Scenario 2 for whiteboard work                          |
| 8     | Practice Preview 2      | Scenario 3 for whiteboard work                          |
| 9     | Printable Worksheet     | Practice problems + Answer key                          |
| 10    | Lesson Summary          | One-page reference card                                 |

Each slide is a complete HTML document (960×540px) separated by `===SLIDE_SEPARATOR===`.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific with learning goals** — "Solve two-step equations with variables on both sides" is better than "algebra"
- **Include strategy preferences** if you have a preferred approach
- **Attach clear images** — the AI uses vision to read the mastery check question
- **Add reference images** of previous worked examples if you want a consistent style
