# Phase 2: Confirm & Plan

## Purpose

Present your analysis to the user, get their confirmation, and plan the three scenarios - all using DIFFERENT contexts from the mastery check. Also surface backward-planning details so the user can validate the instructional design.

## Output Format: PPTX-Compatible HTML

All slides will be **PPTX-compatible HTML** (960×540px, light theme). Slide count varies based on step count (2-5 steps). See `03-generate-slides/02-technical-rules.md` for technical specs.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1 complete
- You have completed the backward planning analysis (following analyze-problem.md Steps 1-6)
- Your output matches the output-schema.md JSON structure

---

## REMINDER: Context Separation

The user provided a **mastery check question**. ALL scenarios you create must use **different contexts and numbers** from that question:

| What                         | Context                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Mastery Check (user's input) | The ACTUAL question students will answer |
| Scenario 1 (Worked Example)  | DIFFERENT context - teaches the strategy |
| Scenario 2 (Practice)        | DIFFERENT context - first practice       |
| Scenario 3 (Practice)        | DIFFERENT context - second practice      |

**Students will see:** Worked Example → Practice 1 → Practice 2 → (then later) Mastery Check

---

## Step 2.1: Present Analysis to User

**Show the user your understanding and WAIT for confirmation.**

Use this exact template (which follows the backward planning protocol — the entire presentation IS backward planning):

```
Based on the mastery check question you provided, here's my analysis:

**Exit Ticket Analysis:**
- Problem Type: [specific type from analysis]
- Key Challenge: [what makes this hard for students]

**Big Idea:** [simplified one-sentence mathematical principle]
- [supporting pattern 1]
- [supporting pattern 2]
- [supporting pattern 3, if applicable]

**Anticipated Misconceptions → Step Design:**
| # | Misconception | Student Work Example | Addressed In |
|---|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1 | [what the student incorrectly believes] | [specific wrong answer they'd make] | Step [N]: [VERB] |
| 2 | [misconception] | [what their work looks like] | Step [N]: [VERB] |
| 3 | [misconception] | [what their work looks like] | Step [N]: [VERB] |

**Design Rationale:** [why the WE is structured this way — how steps connect back to the exit ticket]

**Discovery Questions:**
- Step 1: "[What do you notice...?]"
- Step 2: "[What pattern do you see...?]"
- Step 3: "[How does this compare...?]" (if applicable)

**Strategy:** [name] — "[one-sentence summary]"
**Steps (determined by misconceptions above):**
1. [STEP VERB]: [description] → addresses misconception [N]
2. [STEP VERB]: [description] → addresses misconception [N]
3. [STEP VERB]: [description] → addresses misconception [N] (if needed)
... (2-5 steps, matching misconception count)

**Visual Type:** [from Visual Types table]
**Visual Plan:** [key details - see VisualPlan schemas]

**Scenarios (all DIFFERENT from mastery check):**
- Scenario 1 (worked example): [context + what makes it engaging]
- Scenario 2 (practice): [different context]
- Scenario 3 (practice): [different context]

Note: These scenarios all teach the same skill as your mastery check but use different numbers and contexts, so students learn the strategy without seeing the actual answer.
```

### ⚠️ REQUIRED: Include Diagram Evolution

**Include the Diagram Evolution you created in Phase 1.** This shows the user how the visual will develop step-by-step across slides.

The evolution was already generated in Phase 1 using `reference/diagram-patterns.md` as a guide. Present it here so the user can confirm the visual progression is correct before proceeding.

**Example:**

```
**Diagram Evolution (Scenario 1 - Chicken Nuggets):**

INITIAL STATE (Problem Setup):
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 30                     │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
Total: 30 nuggets, Groups: 5 students, Find: ?

STEP 1: PARTITION
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│   ?    │   ?    │   ?    │   ?    │   ?    │  = 30
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘
+ Divide into 5 equal parts
+ Mark each with ?

STEP 2: CALCULATE
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│   6    │   6    │   6    │   6    │   6    │  = 30 ✓
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘
+ Calculate: 30 ÷ 5 = 6
+ Fill in values

Key elements:
- Each box: nuggets per student
- Total: 30 nuggets
- Unknown (?): number per student

Does this visual progression look right?
```

**Then ask for confirmation:**

```
Does this match what you're looking for? Should I proceed or adjust anything?
```

---

## Step 2.2: WAIT for User Confirmation

**STOP HERE. Do not proceed until the user responds.**

The user might:

- **Confirm** ("yes", "proceed", "looks good") → Continue to Step 2.3
- **Request changes** → Adjust your analysis/strategy and re-present
- **Ask questions** → Answer them, then re-confirm

**Do NOT generate slides until the user explicitly confirms.**

---

## Visual Types

**Choose ONE visual type that best represents the math:**

**Visual selection happens ONCE in analysis, then applies to ALL scenarios.**

---

## Step 2.3: Generate Scenarios (All Different from Mastery Check)

**Only after user confirms**, finalize the three scenarios.

### Critical: Context Separation

**NONE of the scenarios should use the same context or numbers as the mastery check question the user provided.**

The mastery check is what students will answer AFTER completing the worked example and practice. Your scenarios prepare them for it without giving away the answer.

### Scenario Requirements

Each scenario MUST:

- Use the **exact same mathematical structure** as the mastery check
- Require the **exact same strategy** to solve
- Use **DIFFERENT numbers and context** from the mastery check (and from each other)
- Be solvable using the **exact same steps in the exact same order**
- Include a **condensed problem reminder (≤15 words)** for use on step and practice slides

### ⚠️ Visual Progression: Plan What Changes Each Step (REQUIRED for Scenario 1)

**For the worked example (Scenario 1), you MUST define what the visual shows at each step.**

The visual should tell a story that builds toward the answer. Each step adds something new.

**Format:** For each step, describe what gets ADDED or HIGHLIGHTED on the visual.

```
Visual Progression (Scenario 1):
- Setup (Slide 3): [What the visual shows initially - problem state, unknowns visible]
- Step 1 (Slide 4): [What gets highlighted/added after Step 1]
- Step 2 (Slide 5): [What gets highlighted/added after Step 2]
- Step 3 (Slide 6): [What shows the final answer on the visual]
... (include one entry per step — 2-5 steps depending on the strategy)
```

**Note:** The number of step slides varies (2-5). Slide numbers for practice previews and printable shift accordingly. See `01-slide-by-slide.md` for the dynamic slide table.

**Examples by Visual Type:**

| Visual Type        | Setup Shows                 | Step 1 Adds                 | Step 2 Adds          | Final Step Adds      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Tape diagram       | Empty tape with ? and total | Boxes with value per box    | Highlight the count  | Answer label         |
| Coordinate graph   | Blank axes with labels      | First line plotted          | Second line plotted  | Intersection labeled |
| Hanger diagram     | Initial balanced equation   | Subtraction from both sides | Division both sides  | Variable isolated    |
| Double number line | Two lines with known values | Unit rate marked            | Scale factor applied | Unknown value found  |

### ⚠️ Conciseness: Define Problem Reminders NOW

For each scenario, create the **condensed problem reminder** that will appear on slides.

**Format:** Short phrases, not full sentences. Max 15 words.

```
✅ GOOD: "30 nuggets total. 6 per student. How many students?"
✅ GOOD: "Drone: 150m in 30 sec. Find the speed."
❌ BAD:  "A large box has 30 chicken nuggets. If each student gets 6 nuggets, how many students can have a snack?"
```

### Scenario Design Principles

**DO:**

- Match context to grade level interests (gaming, social media, sports, etc.)
- Keep mathematical difficulty identical to mastery check
- Ensure the same moves apply in the same order
- Use engaging, real-world situations
- Give each scenario a visual anchor (icon/theme)
- **Verify each scenario is clearly different from the mastery check**

**DO NOT:**

- Use the same context as the mastery check question
- Use the same numbers as the mastery check question
- Change the problem type
- Add or remove steps from the solution
- Introduce new mathematical concepts
- Create scenarios requiring a different strategy

### Output Template:
