# Phase 3: Generate Slides - Overview

## Purpose

Create 9 PPTX-compatible HTML slides using atomic card-patterns and PPTX animation for CFU/Answer reveals.

**Note:** Slides 1-6 are the worked example, slides 7-8 are practice problem previews for whiteboard work, and slide 9 (the printable worksheet) is generated separately after the main slides complete.

## Output Format

All slides are **960x540px, light theme**. CFU/Answer boxes use PPTX animation (appear on click).

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1 & 2 complete
- User has confirmed your understanding
- You have: PROBLEM ANALYSIS, STRATEGY DEFINITION, THREE SCENARIOS

## Document Reading Order

**Read files in numbered order. Each file has ONE job.**

| Step | File | What It Contains | When to Read |
|------|------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | **00-overview.md** (this file) | Phase purpose, reading order, execution flow | Start here |
| 2 | **01-slide-by-slide.md** | Per-slide protocol, what each slide contains | Before generating |
| 3 | **02-technical-rules.md** | PPTX constraints, data attributes, colors | Before generating |
| 4 | **03-pedagogy.md** | Teaching principles, CFU rules, conciseness | Before generating |
| 5 | **04-svg-workflow.md** | SVG pixel math, graph creation | **Only if Visual Type = SVG** |

**Also read (referenced from card-patterns):**
- `card-patterns/README.md` - Index of HTML patterns
- `../../reference/diagram-patterns.md` - Non-graph SVG patterns (tape diagrams, hangers, etc.)
- `visuals/annotation-zones.md` - Quick zone reference for annotations

**Checklists (use during/after generation):**
- `checklists/pre-flight.md` - Verify BEFORE writing each slide
- `checklists/completion.md` - Verify AFTER all 9 slides done

## Phase 3 Execution Flow

```
STEP 3.0: Read Reference Materials
│         Read files 00 → 01 → 02 → 03 (→ 04 if SVG)
│
▼
STEP 3.1: Check Visual Type (from Phase 1)
│   ├── If "text-only" or "HTML table" → Use simple fill patterns
│   └── If "SVG visual" → Read 04-svg-workflow.md + graph-snippet.html
│
▼
STEP 3.2: Generate Slides 1-6 (Worked Example)
│   For each slide N from 1 to 6:
│     1. Announce checkpoint (CLI mode only)
│     2. Choose layout preset (full-width or two-column)
│     3. Compose using card-patterns
│     4. Verify pre-flight checklist
│     5. Write HTML file
│
▼
STEP 3.3: Generate Slides 7-8 (Practice Problem Previews)
│   For each practice preview (7 and 8):
│     1. Use Problem Setup slide as template
│     2. Replace scenario with Scenario 2 (slide 7) or Scenario 3 (slide 8)
│     3. Include "Your Task:" section with the question
│     4. NO CFU/Answer boxes - students work on whiteboards
│
▼
STEP 3.4: Generate Printable (Slide 9)
│   - Generated separately after slides 1-8 complete
│   - Uses printable-slide-snippet.html pattern
│   - Contains practice problems from Scenarios 2 & 3 + Answer Key
│
▼
STEP 3.5: Verify Completion Checklist
          See checklists/completion.md
```

## Required Reading Before Generating

**BEFORE creating any slides, read these files:**

```
Read: 01-slide-by-slide.md   ← What each slide contains
Read: 02-technical-rules.md  ← PPTX constraints
Read: 03-pedagogy.md         ← Teaching principles
```

**Also read from reference folder:**
```
Read: ../../reference/styling.md        ← Colors, fonts, layout classes
Read: ../../reference/layout-presets.md ← Layout presets + regions
```

---

## 3 Core Patterns

Most slides use just 3 patterns:

| Region | Pattern | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Header | `title-zone.html` | Badge + Title + Subtitle |
| Left column | `content-box.html` | Equations, text (main content) |
| Left column (bottom) | `problem-reminder.html` | Problem reminder at bottom left (≤15 words) |
| Right column | `svg-visual` | Diagrams, graphs (see visuals/) |

**Plus overlays and special cases:**
- `cfu-answer-card.html` → CFU/Answer boxes stacked on same slide (animated, appear on click)
- `graph-snippet.html` → Coordinate graphs (recalculate pixels)
- `slide-teacher-instructions.html` → Slide 1 only (teacher-facing)
- `slide-big-idea.html` → Slide 2 only (student-facing Big Idea)
- `printable-slide-snippet.html` → Slide 9 only (printable worksheet)

**Always READ and COPY from snippet files.** Never write HTML from scratch.

## File Output Structure

Write each slide to a separate file:

```
src/app/presentations/{slug}/
├── slide-1.html   (Teacher Instructions - Big Idea, Learning Targets, Strategy)
├── slide-2.html   (Big Idea - student-facing)
├── slide-3.html   (Problem Setup)
├── slide-4.html   (Step 1 + CFU + Answer stacked)
├── slide-5.html   (Step 2 + CFU + Answer stacked)
├── slide-6.html   (Step 3 + CFU + Answer stacked)
├── slide-7.html   (Practice Problem 1 Preview - Scenario 2)
├── slide-8.html   (Practice Problem 2 Preview - Scenario 3)
└── slide-9.html   (Printable with Practice Problems 1 & 2 + Answer Key)
```

Use the Write tool for each slide file.

### Track Progress After Each Slide

**After writing EACH slide file**, update the progress file:

```json
{
  "slidesCompleted": ["slide-1.html", "slide-2.html", ...],
  "updatedAt": "[ISO timestamp]"
}
```

---

## NEXT PHASE

**When all slides are written:**

Use the Read tool to read the Phase 4 instructions:
```
Read: .claude/skills/create-worked-example-sg/phases/04-save-to-database.md
```

Do NOT proceed until all slide files have been written.
