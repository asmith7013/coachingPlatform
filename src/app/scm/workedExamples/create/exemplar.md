**Gr8 Unit 4 Lesson 7: “All, Some, or No Solutions”**

**Exit Ticket:**

3x + 8 = 3x + \_\_\_\_

What value could you write in after "3x +" that would make the equation true for:

1. no values of x?
2. all values of x?
3. just one value of x?

**Exit Ticket Student Response:**

1. Any value other than 8.
2. 8
3. Any variable term, like x or 2x, in order to create an equation with one solution.

**BIG IDEA: What does a student need to know, do, or understand to get this problem correct? (First draft)**

- A one variable equation of the form ax + b = cx + d has infinite solutions if the coefficients are equal and the constants are equal (a = c and b = d).
  - Using inverse operations, this is because you can eliminate both terms from both sides, yielding either 0 = 0 or x = x which is always true.
- A one variable equation of the form ax + b = cx + d has no solutions if the coefficients are equal but the constants are unequal (a = c but b d).
  - Using inverse operations, this is because you can eliminate the variable term from both sides, yielding b = d which is never true.
- A one variable equation of the form ax + b = cx + d has one solution if the coefficients are unequal (a c).
  - Structurally, this is because you can eliminate one variable term and one constant term, yielding x = f which is only true when x has a value of f.

**BIG IDEA: What does a student need to know, do, or understand to get this problem correct? (Revised draft → simplified)**

The structure of an equation helps us predict how many solutions it will have.

- ax + b = ax + b (same coefficients, same constants): infinite solutions
- ax + b = ax + d (same coefficients, different constants): no solutions
- ax + b = cx + d (different coefficients, different constants): one solution

We can use inverse operations to create a simple equation such as x = x, x = a, or a = b to determine the number of solutions.

**Anticipated Misconceptions:**

1. Student thinks that a different constant (other than 8) will yield ONE solution
   1. What this looks like:
      1. Question 1:
      2. Question 2:
      3. Question 3: The value could be 10.
2. Student confuses no solution with infinite solutions
   1. What this looks like:
      1. Question 1: The value could be 8.
      2. Question 2: The value could be 10.
      3. Question 3:
3. Student assumes every equation has one solution
   1. What this looks like:
      1. Question 1: Not possible.
      2. Question 2: Not possible.
      3. Question 3:

**Worked Example - Thinking**

I want to create a problem(s) similar to the Exit Ticket problem that will surface all of the know/do/understands necessary for success on the Exit Ticket. This means I’ll need a problem(s) where students are working with equations that have none, one, and infinite solutions so students can compare how they are different. I want them to notice both the structure of the equation and the structure of the solution. I am going to have students solve more than 1 equation of each type so they can observe patterns.

**Worked Example - Step 1**

Equation with One Solution

Use inverse operations to solve the following equations. What do you notice about the structure of the equations? What do you notice about your solutions?

2x + 5 = x + 10

4x - 1 = 6x - 3

3x + 4 = 5x - 2

Show the work for how to use inverse operations to solve each equation.

X = 5

X = 1

X = 3

What do you notice about the structure of the equations?

- Both sides are written in the form ax + b
- The coefficients are different
- The constants are different

What do you notice about your solutions?

- Each equation has only one solution,
- I was able to eliminate the variable term from one side and the constant term from one side
- All of the solutions are of the form x = a

Stamp the Big Idea about equations with ONE solution.

**Worked Example - Step 2**

Equation with No Solutions

Use inverse operations to solve the following equations. What do you notice about the structure of the equations? What do you notice about your solutions?

x + 1 = x + 7

2x + 3 = 2x + 5

10x - 6 = 10x - 9

Show the work for how to use inverse operations to solve each equation.

1 = 7

3 = 5

- 6 = -9

What do you notice about the structure of the equations?

- Both sides are written in the form ax + b
- The coefficients are the same
- The constants are different

What do you notice about your solutions?

- The equations have no solutions
- I was able to eliminate the variable terms from both sides and I was left two unequal constants
- All of the solutions are of the form a = b

Stamp the Big Idea about equations with NO solution. (a can never equal b)

**Worked Example - Step 3**

Equation with Infinite Solutions

Use inverse operations to solve the following equations. What do you notice about the structure of the equations? What do you notice about your solutions?

2x + 5 = 2x + 5

4x - 1 = 4x - 1

3x = 3x

Show the work for how to use inverse operations to solve each equation.

0 = 0

x = x (if a student adds 1 to both sides, then divides both sides by 4)

Same: 0 = 0 or x = x

What do you notice about the structure of the equations?

- Both sides are written in the form ax + b
- The coefficients are the same
- The constants are the same

What do you notice about your solutions?

- Each equation has infinite solutions
- I was able to eliminate the variable term from both sides and the constant term from both sides
- All of the solutions are of the form x = x or a = a. This is always true.

Stamp the Big Idea about equations with INFINITE solutions.

**Closing**

Last Slide of the Worked Example should show students all 3 Equation Types next to each other, as a summary, so they can see how the structures differ.
