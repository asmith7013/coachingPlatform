# Question Text
A train traveled 450 miles in 5 hours. What was the average speed of the train in miles per hour? Show all your work and explain how you solved.

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student calculates the correct answer (90 mph) and shows their division work.
- Sample responses
  - "450 ÷ 5 = 90 mph. I divided total distance by total time."
  - "450 miles ÷ 5 hours = 90 miles per hour using long division."
  - "I used the formula: speed = distance ÷ time, so 450 ÷ 5 = 90 mph"
  - "5 × 90 = 450, so the train went 90 miles each hour."
