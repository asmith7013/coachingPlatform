# Question Text
Solve the problems below, then explain how you used place value to help you solve.

80 ÷ 8 = _____________
600 ÷ 60 = _____________
400 ÷ 10 = _____________

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student solves all three problems correctly (10, 10, 40) and explains using place value reasoning.
- Sample responses
  - "80 ÷ 8 = 10 because 8 tens ÷ 8 = 1 ten"
  - "600 ÷ 60 = 10 because 6 hundreds ÷ 6 tens = 10"
  - "400 ÷ 10 = 40 because I can think of 400 as 40 tens, so 40 tens ÷ 10 = 40"
  - "I used the pattern that dividing by 10 moves the decimal point one place left"
