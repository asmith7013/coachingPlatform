# Question Text

Which of the lines below show a proportional relationship? Explain your reasoning.

[Image shows: A coordinate plane graph with three lines labeled A, B, and C. Line A (red) passes through points at (1,3), (2,6), and (3,9) with a slope of 3. Line B (blue) has a y-intercept of 2 and points including (0,2), (1,5), and (2,8) with a slope of 3. Line C (green) does not start on the y-intercept - passes through points (1,2), (2,4), and (4,8) with a slope of 2. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 5 and y-axis ranges from 0 to 12.]

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly identifies that Line A shows a proportional relationship because it passes through the origin (0,0), and explains why Lines B and C are not proportional.
- Sample responses
  - "Line A shows a proportional relationship because it passes through the origin (0,0) and forms a straight line. Lines B and C are not proportional because neither passes through the origin."
  - "Only Line A is proportional. A proportional relationship must pass through (0,0), and only Line A does that. Line B starts at (0,2) and Line C doesn't go through the origin either."
