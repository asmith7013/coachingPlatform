# Question Text

The location of some places are listed below. Plot all four locations on the coordinate plane with a clear label. Explain your process for plotting each point.

Library: (-3,4)

Coffee Shop: (2,-1)

Park: (-2,-3)

Post Office: (1,3)

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly plots all four locations at the given coordinates and labels them clearly.
- Sample responses
  - "For the Library at (-3,4), I started at the origin, moved 3 units left (negative x), and 4 units up (positive y). For Coffee Shop at (2,-1), I moved 2 right and 1 down. For Park at (-2,-3), I moved 2 left and 3 down. For Post Office at (1,3), I moved 1 right and 3 up."
  - "I plotted each point by using the first number for the x-coordinate (left/right) and the second number for the y-coordinate (up/down). Library: 3 left, 4 up. Coffee Shop: 2 right, 1 down. Park: 2 left, 3 down. Post Office: 1 right, 3 up."
