# Question Text

Classify each triangle below as acute, right, or obtuse. Explain how you classified each triangle.

Triangle A: angles measure 45°, 65°, and 70°

Triangle B: angles measure 30°, 60°, and 90°

Triangle C: angles measure 25°, 35°, and 120°

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly classifies Triangle A as acute, Triangle B as right, and Triangle C as obtuse, with explanations for each.
- Sample responses
  - "Triangle A is acute because all three angles (45°, 65°, 70°) are less than 90°. Triangle B is right because it has one 90° angle. Triangle C is obtuse because it has one angle (120°) that is greater than 90°."
  - "A is acute (all angles under 90°), B is right (has a 90° angle), and C is obtuse (has an angle over 90°)."
