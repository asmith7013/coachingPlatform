# Question Text

Are the ratios below equivalent? Explain how you know.

3/5 : 6/10

4/6 : 4/10

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly identifies that 3/5 is equivalent to 6/10 and that 4/6 is not equivalent to 4/10, with clear reasoning.
- Sample responses
  - "3/5 is equivalent to 6/10 because 6/10 simplifies to 3/5 when you divide both by 2. 4/6 is not equivalent to 4/10 because 4/6 simplifies to 2/3 but 4/10 simplifies to 2/5, and those are different."
  - "3/5 = 6/10 because I can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/5 by 2 to get 6/10. 4/6 â‰  4/10 because there is nothing I can multiply or divide 4/6 by to get 4/10."
