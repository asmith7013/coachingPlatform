# Question Text

Are the triangles on the coordinate plane below congruent? Explain why or why not.

[Image shows: A coordinate plane with two triangles. Triangle ABC (blue) has vertices at A(1,2), B(4,2), and C(3,5). Triangle DEF (red) has vertices at F(-5,3), E(-2,4), and D(-2,1). The x-axis ranges from -6 to 5 and y-axis ranges from -1 to 6. Both triangles appear to be similar in size and shape but in different positions and orientations on the plane.]

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly identifies that the triangles are congruent and provides reasoning based on equal side lengths or transformations.
- Sample responses
  - "Yes, both triangles have the same side lengths so they are congruent. They are just in different positions on the coordinate plane."
  - "Yes, the triangles are congruent because a sequence of transformations (rotation, reflection, and/or translation) can move the red triangle to the exact position as the blue triangle."
