# Question Text

Classify each triangle below as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. Explain how you classified each triangle.

[Image shows: Three triangles labeled Triangle A, Triangle B, and Triangle C.

Triangle A: A triangle with side lengths of 8, 10, and 5.

Triangle B: A triangle with side lengths of 6, 6, and 9.

Triangle C: A triangle with all three side lengths equal to 7.]

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly classifies Triangle A as scalene, Triangle B as isosceles, and Triangle C as equilateral, with explanations for each.
- Sample responses
  - "Triangle A is scalene because all three side lengths (8, 10, 5) are different. Triangle B is isosceles because two sides are the same length (6 and 6). Triangle C is equilateral because all three sides are equal (7, 7, 7)."
  - "A is scalene (all sides different), B is isosceles (two sides equal at 6), and C is equilateral (all sides equal at 7)."
