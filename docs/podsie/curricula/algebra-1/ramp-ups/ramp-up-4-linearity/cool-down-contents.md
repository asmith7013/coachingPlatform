# Question Text

Which graph(s) represents a linear function? Explain how you know.

[Image shows: Six coordinate plane graphs labeled A through F:

**Graph A:** Shows a straight line with positive slope going through the origin - first point is (0,0)

**Graph B:** Shows a curved line

**Graph C:** Shows two straight line segments forming a V-shape (absolute value type graph)

**Graph D:** Shows a vertical line

**Graph E:** Shows a straight line with negative slope (y-intercept at 2)

**Graph F:** Shows a horizontal line at x = -3.5

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly identifies Graphs A and E as linear functions and explains that they are straight lines with constant rates of change.
- Sample responses
  - "Graphs A and E represent linear functions. They are both straight lines, which means they have a constant rate of change (slope). A has a positive slope and goes through the origin, and E has a negative slope with a y-intercept at 2."
  - "A and E are linear functions because they are straight lines. Linear functions have equations in the form y = mx + b, and these graphs show that pattern. The others are either curved (B), piecewise (C), vertical (D), or horizontal (F)."
