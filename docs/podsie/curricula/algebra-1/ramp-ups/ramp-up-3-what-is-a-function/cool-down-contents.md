# Question Text

Which graph represents a function? Explain how you know.

[Image shows: Four coordinate plane graphs labeled A, B, C, and D:

**Graph A:** Shows a curved line that resembles a sideways parabola opening to the left, symmetric about the x-axis

**Graph B:** Shows a vertical line at x = -1

**Graph C:** Shows a curved line that resembles an S-curve or sigmoid function, increasing from bottom left to top right

**Graph D:** Shows a circle centered at the origin]

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly identifies Graph C as the function and explains why using the vertical line test or the definition of a function (one output for every one input)
- Sample responses
  - "Graph C represents a function. I can tell because if I draw any vertical line through the graph, it only touches the curve once. This means each input (x-value) has exactly one output (y-value)."
  - "C is a function because it passes the vertical line test. For every x-value, there is only one y-value. The other graphs fail because A and D have multiple y-values for some x-values, and B is a vertical line which has infinitely many y-values for one x-value."
