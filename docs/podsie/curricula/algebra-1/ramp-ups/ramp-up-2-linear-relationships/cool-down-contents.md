# Question Text

A community center is filling the pool for the summer. The pool starts empty and water is added at a constant rate. Which table below represents this situation? Explain how you know.

[Image shows: Three tables labeled Table A, Table B, and Table C, each showing "Time (hours)" and "Water (gallons)" data:

**Table A:**
- Time (hours): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Water (gallons): 0, 50, 100, 150, 200

**Table B:**
- Time (hours): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Water (gallons): 100, 150, 200, 250, 300

**Table C:**
- Time (hours): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Water (gallons): 0, 50, 150, 300, 500]

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly identifies Table A and explains that at 0 hours the pool is empty (0 gallons) and each hour 50 gallons of water is added (a constant rate).
- Sample responses
  - "Table A represents this situation because at 0 hours the pool is empty (0 gallons) and each hour 50 gallons of water is added, which is a constant rate."
  - "It's Table A. The pool starts empty at 0 hours with 0 gallons. Then it increases by 50 gallons every hour (50, 100, 150, 200), which means the rate is constant."
