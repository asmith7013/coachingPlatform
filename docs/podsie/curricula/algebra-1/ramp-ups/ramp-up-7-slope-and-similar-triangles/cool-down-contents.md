# Question Text

What is the equation of the line shown below? Explain what each value in your equation represents.

[Image shows: A coordinate plane with x-axis labeled from -6 to 7 and y-axis (labeled as "y-axis") labeled from -3 to 6. A green straight line is graphed on the plane. The line has a slope of -2 and a y-intercept of 3]

# Acceptance Criteria

- Student correctly writes the equation y = -2x + 3 and explains what each value represents (slope and y-intercept).
- Sample responses
  - "The equation is y = -2x + 3. The -2 is the slope, which means the line goes down 2 units for every 1 unit it goes right. The 3 is the y-intercept, which is where the line crosses the y-axis."
  - "y = -2x + 3. In this equation, -2 represents the slope (rate of change), showing that for each increase of 1 in x, y decreases by 2. The +3 represents the y-intercept, which is the point (0, 3) where the line crosses the y-axis."
