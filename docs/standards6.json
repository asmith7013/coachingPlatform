Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve problems involving finding the whole, given a part and the percent. Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units; manipulate and transform units appropriately when multiplying or dividing quantities."
