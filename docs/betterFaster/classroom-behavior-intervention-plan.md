# Classroom Behavior Intervention Plan

## Behaviors This Addresses

Cursing, eating in class, screaming/yelling, getting out of seat, not sitting in assigned seat, asking for help then responding with attitude.

## In-Class Intervention Steps

| Step | What Happens | What Teacher Says |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Step 1: Silent Redirect** | Walk toward the student. Make eye contact. Use a non-verbal gesture (point to seat, shake head, gesture to put food away). Keep teaching. | *Nothing — it's silent.* |
| **Step 2: Quick Verbal Reminder** | Say the student's name + a 3-5 word direction. Formal tone. No lecture. Continue teaching immediately — don't wait for a response. | *"Marcus — in your seat." / "Aisha — language." / "Devon — food away, thank you." / "Jaylen — voice down."* |
| **Step 3: Outside Conversation** | If behavior continues after Step 2, student steps to the door for a 30-second private conversation. | **1.** *"Here's what I noticed — you [name the behavior]."* **2.** *"Here's what I need from you — [name the expectation]."* **3.** *"Can you commit to that for the rest of class?"* **4.** *"Thank you. Head back in."* |

## When Outside Conversations Repeat

| Trigger | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| **1st outside conversation** | Recommit conversation, student goes back to class |
| **2nd outside conversation in the same week** | Phone call home — teacher and student call the parent together. The student explains what happened. |
| **3rd outside conversation in the same week (or pattern continues into the following week)** | Parent meeting or admin referral |

The count resets every Monday. Clean slate each week.

## Rolling This Out to Students

Use the **procedure rollout slide** to make this visible and concrete:

### [Procedure]: Responding to Behaviors That Hurt Our Class Community

| | |
|---|---|
| **When** | Anytime during class — when cursing, yelling, eating, leaving seat, or refusing assigned seat happens |
| **Why** | "We all deserve a classroom where we can focus and learn. This system protects our learning time." |
| **What** | **Step 1:** Silent redirect (proximity, eye contact, gesture) |
| | **Step 2:** Quick verbal reminder (name + 3-5 word direction) |
| | **Step 3:** Outside conversation (30 seconds, recommit, back in) |

### How to roll it out:

1. **Name it plainly:** *"I'm going to tell you about how things will work from now on when something happens that hurts our classroom."*
2. **Model the I Do:** Walk through each step so students can see exactly what it looks like — act out what a silent redirect looks like, what a verbal reminder sounds like, what stepping outside looks like.
3. **Keep it positive and brief:** Frame it as *"this is how we protect our learning time,"* not as punishment.
4. **Be ready for Day 1 testing:** Follow through immediately and calmly on the very first behavior. The first response sets the tone for whether students believe the system is real. Do not skip steps. Do not negotiate. Do not lecture.
