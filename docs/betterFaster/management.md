# Get Better Faster: Management Trajectory

**Source:** Uncommon Schools — Top Action Steps Used by Instructional Leaders to Launch a Teacher's Development

The Management Trajectory focuses on classroom culture, behavior systems, and student engagement. Action steps are numbered 1–12 sequentially across phases. Each action step includes a **Coaching Guide** with diagnostic triggers, probing questions, practice scenarios, and real-time feedback cues for instructional leaders.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Teaching (Summer PD) — Develop Essential Routines & Procedures

### 1. Routines & Procedures 101: Design and Roll Out

**Plan & practice critical routines and procedures moment-by-moment:**
- Explain what each routine means and what it will look like.
- Write out what teacher and students do at each step, and what will happen with students who don't follow the routine.

**Plan & practice the roll out (how to introduce the routine for the first time):**
- Plan the "I Do": how you will model the routine.
- Plan what you will do when students don't get it right.

#### Coaching Guide: Plan & Practice Critical Routines & Procedures

**When to Use It:** Teacher does not have clear routines established for the classroom.

**Probing Questions:**
- (Show a model video or do a live model): "What is each step the teacher takes in this routine?" "What is the teacher doing and what are the students doing?"
- "Describe what you want [certain routine] to look like. Ideally, what would students do during that transition/routine? What would you be doing?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Complete the template for the key routines in the teacher's classroom (most important: student entry and exit, transitions, materials distribution, and listening). Rehearse in the classroom setting.
- Round 1: basic mastery — focus on the specific words and actions the teacher will use, such as where to look and stand, and key ways to break the routine down into smaller steps for the students.
- Round 2: add minor student errors in following instructions (not too much: you want to build muscle memory!)

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

#### Coaching Guide: Plan & Practice the Roll-Out

**When to Use It:** Routine is new for the students (beginning of the year or when changing a routine).

**Probing Questions:**
- (Show a model video or do a live model of an effective rollout): "What did you notice about that rollout that made it effective?"
- "What will be the most difficult parts of the routine for you to deliver and for students to master?"
- "What are the key micro-actions for you to model to perfect this part of the routine?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Focus on scripting the I Do: break it down, pregnant pause, repeat step-by-step.
- Keep the language positive and enthusiastic, including a challenge.
- Memorize the roll-out speech, then stand up and practice.
- Leader or peers should play roles of students to make practice more authentic.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Model: If the teacher modeling is ineffective, prompt: "Mr. Smith, am I following your model effectively?" [then model the correct actions and narrate what you're doing]

---

### 2. Strong Voice: Stand and Speak with Purpose

- **Square Up, Stand Still:** When giving instructions, stop moving and strike a formal pose.
- **Formal Register:** When giving instructions, use formal register, including tone and word choice.

#### Coaching Guide: Square Up, Stand Still

**When to Use It:** Posture — teacher undermines his or her leadership presence by slouching, shifting foot to foot, or facing at an angle away from the students.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch video]: "How does the teacher use her body language to communicate leadership in her classroom?"
- [Model giving directions with a relaxed posture, then while squaring up and standing still]: "What is the difference in the way I communicated the first way versus the second way?"
- "What is the value in communicating leadership with our body language?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Practice maintaining a formal posture while delivering a lesson on routines and procedures. Note when the teacher is squaring up and standing still, and when the teacher's body begins to become informal/weak.
- Film the practice — or use a mirror — so that the new teacher can see what he or she looks like while delivering instructions.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Non-verbal: Model exaggerated posture and stance — shift your body upward and arch shoulders to remind the teacher to square up and stand still.

#### Coaching Guide: Formal Register

**When to Use It:** Tone — the teacher's vocal register is too casual or informal.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Imagine you had to say 'it's time to leave' to three different audiences: your friend after dinner, a symphony concert audience at the end of a performance, or when a building is on fire. Speak out loud how you would deliver those words differently to each audience." [After doing so] "What is the value and purpose of the middle one: your formal register?"
- "When is it important to use formal register? What message does it send to the students?"
- For a teacher who knows formal register: "What are the keys to formal register?"
- (Watch video of their classroom): "What conditions lead to you drop your formal register?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Videotape the teacher during practice, and review the footage so the teacher can hear when he/she is maintaining a formal register, and when his/her register begins to become casual/informal.
- Practice maintaining a formal tone while delivering a lesson on routines and procedures. Note when the teacher is maintaining a formal register, and when the teacher's register becomes too informal or casual.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Non-verbal: combine square up/stand still gesture with pointing to your mouth to remind the teacher to speak in a formal register.

### Additional Topics to Introduce (not yet expected to master)

- Least invasive intervention
- Narrate the Positive
- Create a Challenge / Build Momentum
- Teacher Radar: know when students are off-task
- Do It Again: practice routines to perfection — have students do it again if not done correctly (and know when to stop Do It Again)

---

## Phase 2: Days 1–30 — Roll Out & Monitor Routines

### 3. What to Do

- **Economy of Language:** Give crisp instructions with as few words as possible (e.g., 3-word directions). Check for understanding on complex instructions.

#### Coaching Guide: Economy of Language

**When to Use It:** The teacher's directions are unclear or use too many words.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What happened yesterday when you asked your students to ___? What caused the confusion?"
- "What is the value in using fewer words to describe what students should do?"
- [Play video of teacher's instructions] "What is another way you could have restated these directions to make them clearer for students?" OR "Write down all the directions you gave. Where did you use more words than needed?"
- [If teacher struggles, model for them]: "Let me deliver those same instructions [Model]. What do you notice about the difference between my delivery and your own?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Script clear, concise instructions together. Plan them out word-by-word: don't take shortcuts! Remove all extraneous words.
- Provide feedback on clarity before practice: most errors can be fixed before your practice.
- Rehearse key directions: if necessary, model for teacher what is most effective.
- Focus on the pregnant pause between each component of the instruction: students often become confused when given too many directions at once.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Non-verbal: hold up a red card for too many words.
- Non-verbal: hold up a sign that says "What to Do."
- Whisper prompt: "When you bring everyone back from this assignment, just say: 'Pencils down. Eyes on me!' No extra words."
- Model: Model giving concise directions using 3–5 words.
- Model: Ask a student to repeat the teacher's instructions.

---

### 4. Routines & Procedures 201: Revise and Perfect Them

- Revise any routine that needs more attention to detail or is inefficient, with particular emphasis on what students and teachers are doing at each moment.
- **Do It Again:** Have students do the routine again if not done correctly the first time.
- **Cut It Short:** Know when to stop the Do It Again.

#### Coaching Guide: Revise Routines

**When to Use It:** Students are following the routine but it is inefficient or ineffective.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What has been the challenge in implementing this routine?"
- "Where does the breakdown begin: when is the first moment of students not following the routine?"
- [Watch video of a better routine] "What can we draw from this routine to make your own more effective?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Focus practice at the point where the routine has been going wrong. Model any student errors you anticipate.
- Pay attention to teacher positioning: (stand in ideal location), and incorporate Strong Voice (posture, register), and What to Do.
- Rehearse the first words to say to noncompliant students.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Model: "This is my favorite routine. Can I show our students the new way to do it?"

#### Coaching Guide: Do It Again

**When to Use It:** The routine is effective, but students aren't following it.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What are the keys to running a Do it Again effectively?"
- "Why is it important to have students repeat this routine when they haven't done it correctly?"
- [Watch video] "Where are the moments when students are incorrectly executing the routine? What would you like to see them do differently?"
- "What is challenging about noticing or stating what you want to see students change when they Do it Again?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan each step of the Do it Again sequence: Strong Voice (square up, stand still, use formal register); What to Do (name the error, name the correct action); Challenge the students to do better; Give the signal to restart the routine.
- Role play the revised routine: Make the same student errors from class and have the teacher practice implementing Do it Again until the routine looks flawless.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Non-verbal: Make a circle with your finger to cue teacher to have students re-do that part of routine.
- Verbal: "Ms. Smith, I know we can do that better. What would you like to see us do differently this time?"
- Model: "Can I show our students what we'd like them to do?" (whisper to teacher what you are modeling)

#### Coaching Guide: Cut It Short

**When to Use It:** The teacher asks students to re-do routines they have already performed sufficiently well.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Remember when you had students do it again for the third time? Did they perform it even better after that?"
- "What is the purpose of having your students do it again? When is it no longer valuable to do it again?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Practice Cut it Short the same way as you would practice Do it Again, but with extra emphasis on the conclusion of the Do it Again. As you repeat the practice, try varying up how quickly you perform the routine correctly so the teacher learns to truly evaluate when it's time to stop the Do it Again.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: signal to the teacher that it's time to stop repeating the Do It Again.
- Model: cut short the Do It Again.

---

### 5. Teacher Radar: Know When Students Are Off Task

**Deliberately scan the room for on-task behavior:**
- Choose 3–4 "hot spots" (places where students often get off task) to scan constantly.
- "Be Seen Looking": Crane your neck to appear to be seeing all corners of the room.

**Circulate the room with purpose (break the plane):**
- Move among the desks and around the perimeter.
- Stand at the corners: Identify 3 spots on the perimeter of the room to which you can circulate to stand and monitor student work.
- Move away from the student who's speaking to monitor the whole room.

#### Coaching Guide: Scan Hot Spots

**When to Use It:** Teacher is not noticing the earliest actions of off-task behavior.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch video of class] "At what moment do the first students begin to go off track?"
- "Which students are most often off-task?"
- "If you know these students are most likely to veer off track, what are your 'hot spots' that you want to scan continuously throughout the lesson?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Identify hot spots and moments in the lesson plan to scan hot spots.
- Practice: role play student behavior you want the teacher to be able to catch and correct by scanning. Repeat until the teacher is consistently scanning the hot spots and identifying off-task behavior.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Hold up sign that says "scan."
- Hold your hand out over a hot spot at the moment you want the teacher to notice and correct off-task behavior.

#### Coaching Guide: Be Seen Looking

**When to Use It:** The teacher is not scanning and watching the students; students veer off task as a result.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch video of lesson and pick key moments] "Where are you looking right now? Where should you be looking?"
- [Model Be Seen Looking] "What did you notice about what I did when giving directions? What is the value of that body language?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Practice scanning every row (for students' hands and eyes) of the classroom while teaching.
- Sit in the classroom far from the teacher. Model off-task behavior for the teacher to identify when scanning.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Non-verbal: Crane your neck to indicate that teacher should do the same.
- Model: Take over the routine and crane neck/scan with finger while scanning students.

#### Coaching Guide: Circulate with Purpose (Break the Plane)

**When to Use It:** Teacher is stationary — lack of movement makes students go off-task.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Where did the off-task behavior start? Where were you standing at that time? What is the challenge of not moving around during the lesson?"
- [Watch the video] "How much time do you spend away from the front of the room?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Identify the hot spots in the room (i.e., where off-task behaviors often occur).
- Create a pathway based on the hot spots.
- Practice moving along this pathway while teaching, stopping at hot spots to scan and giving students a non-verbal redirect.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: point to a corner of the room where they should stand.

#### Coaching Guide: Move Away from the Student Who Is Speaking

**When to Use It:** When one student is speaking, other students become disengaged.

**Probing Questions:**
- "When did the off-task behavior start? Where were you in the classroom in relation to where the problem occurred?"
- "What is the value of moving away from the student who is speaking?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Have the teacher pretend to call on an imaginary student. Then, while the imaginary student is responding, you can be playing the part of another student in another part of the room who is off-task. The teacher can then practice moving around to remind the other student that he or she is still obligated to pay attention, and, if necessary, to give a silent re-direct.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: cue the teacher to move away from the student who is speaking.

---

### 6. Whole-Class Reset

- Implement a **planned whole-class reset** to re-establish student behavioral expectations when a class routine has slowly weakened over previous classes.
- Implement an **"in-the-moment reset"** when a class veers off task during the class period.
  - Example: Stop teaching. Square up. Give a clear What to Do: "Pencils down. Eyes on me. Hands folded in 3-2-1. Thank you: that's what Harvard looks like." Pick up tone & energy again.

#### Coaching Guide: Planned Reset

**When to Use It:** A class has slid into low engagement over a few days without the teacher realizing it.

**Probing Questions:**
- "How did you establish that routine so effectively the first time?"
- "What are the challenges in implementing the routine right now? Where does this routine break down?"
- "What are the root causes of the deterioration of this routine?"
- [Show a model: video or yourself modeling]: "What did you notice: what were the key actions the teacher took to re-engage the classroom?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Script the reset word-by-word: use as minimal language as possible, e.g.: Pause. "Eyes on me." Narrate the problem & give a direction. Scan. Wait for 100%. If not there, give a second direction to off-task students. Continue the lesson.
- Practice: incorporate all previous action steps, particularly: Strong Voice (posture & register); What to Do; teacher radar (scan).
- Rd 1: all students "comply" right away.
- Rd 2: a few students still don't comply and teacher has to get them on target.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A (planned in advance)

#### Coaching Guide: In-the-Moment Reset

**When to Use It:** A class has slid into low engagement within the same class period without the teacher realizing it.

**Probing Questions:**
- "When are typical moments when your students go off track?" (If the teacher cannot answer, show him or her video footage of a part of the class when students frequently go off track, and use the video to guide the teacher in identifying the moment when a reset is needed.)
- "What are the key indicators in the class that you can look for that will tell you it is time to reset the class?"
- "When have you been most successful in resetting the classroom? How could you apply those same skills to this other context?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- From video of the teacher's classroom, practice the moment when engagement drops.
- Script a generic in-the-moment reset that could be used in every situation: Pause, "Eyes on me," narrate the problem, give direction, scan, and wait for 100%. If not there, give a second direction to students not on task. Continue the lesson.
- Incorporate previous action steps.
- Rd 1: all students "comply" right away.
- Rd 2: a few students still don't comply and teacher has to get them on target.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: create a cue for "reset" or hold up a sign.
- Model: "Students, we need to reset ourselves right now." Model a reset for the teacher.

---

## Phase 3: Days 31–60 — Engage Every Student

### 7. Build the Momentum

- Give students a simple challenge to complete a task. Example: "Now I know you're only 4th graders, but I have a 5th grade problem that I bet you could master!"
- **Sparkle:** Speak faster, walk faster, vary your voice, and smile.

#### Coaching Guide: Create a Challenge

**When to Use It:** Teacher states or acknowledges the boring/hard nature of the content they are teaching.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch model video] "What does this teacher say to get her students so excited to complete the task?"
- "What is the value of providing a challenge to build momentum in the class?"
- "Where in your lesson did you miss an opportunity to create a challenge? What could you do differently?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Have teacher script challenges into lesson plan and practice delivering them.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Pump your hands in the air like a cheerleader.
- Model: model creating a challenge.

#### Coaching Guide: Speak Faster, Vary Your Voice, and Smile

**When to Use It:** Teacher's tone doesn't convey the joy and excitement that should infuse the classroom.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Show model video]: "What do you notice about Ms. Smith's tone in this clip? What does she do to make her delivery sparkle?"
- "Now think about your own classroom. What's creating the gap between this teacher's tone and yours?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Teach part of upcoming lesson while speaking faster and smiling.
- Stop teacher and repeat what teacher has just said while smiling and speaking more quickly.
- Have the teacher vary their voice, dropping lower to create tension rather than always remaining at high or low volume.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Point to corners of your mouth to remind teacher to smile, or gesture with your hand to remind him or her to speak more quickly.
- Whisper prompt: "Sparkle! Smile! Jump back into teaching!"

---

### 8. Pacing: Create the Illusion of Speed

- Use a hand-held timer to stick to the time stamps in the lesson and give students an audio cue that it's time to move on.
- Increase rate of questioning: no more than 2 seconds between when a student responds and the teacher picks back up instruction.
- Use countdowns to work the clock ("Do that in 5… 4… 3… 2… 1").
- Use Call and Response for key words.

#### Coaching Guide: Use a Timer

**When to Use It:** Teacher falls way behind the planned pacing of their lesson plan.

**Probing Questions:**
- "How much time did you want to spend on the 'I Do' part of the lesson? What kept you from sticking to that amount of time?"
- "How much time had you planned to have left for independent work at the end of the lesson? What kept you from having enough time?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan: review time stamps for each part of the lesson. Script how to move on when the timer goes off and the teacher hasn't finished that section. Plan where teacher can cut certain parts of the lesson when falling behind.
- Practice lesson with a timer. Rehearse what to do when timer goes off & teacher isn't finished with that section.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Non-verbal: point at watch/wrist when time to move on.
- Non-verbal: give a hand signal of how many more minutes to stay on this activity.

#### Coaching Guide: Increase Rate of Questioning

**When to Use It:** Teacher pauses too long between questions, losing the students' engagement.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the key to pacing? Given that principle, what do you think is the ideal amount of time after each student answer before you ask another question?"
- "Do you recall what happened after you called on Max yesterday? What would you need in order to keep instruction moving more immediately after calling on a student?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Role play a questioning sequence from an upcoming lesson keeping track of the rate of questioning. Note specifically moments where the rate slows due to pauses in between questions and lack of teacher preparation. Key teacher actions to look for: knowing the questions cold, and knowing which student to call on.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Model: model the questioning pace for the teacher.

#### Coaching Guide: Countdown to Work the Clock

**When to Use It:** Students are slow to move during lesson transitions: e.g., whole class to pairs to IP, etc.

**Probing Questions:**
- "How much time did you want to take in this transition?"
- [Watch model video]: "What actions does the teacher take to go faster? How could you apply them to your lesson?"
- "How could you challenge your students to work with greater purpose?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Script and practice Bright Lines — cues to signal switching between activities: claps, hand gestures, etc.
- Play part of students and have teacher transition from one activity to the next using a countdown to work the clock.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: signal "5-4-3-2-1" with your fingers when it's time for a countdown.

#### Coaching Guide: Call & Response

**When to Use It:** Students lose focus/engagement while teacher is modeling or talking.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the purpose of a choral response? How does it add value to engagement both behaviorally and academically?"
- "Here's a video clip from your lesson yesterday. Where could you have used a choral response to increase engagement?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Identify moments when it would be most useful to implement a choral response.
- Role play: provide occasional lackluster responses so teacher can practice having students Do it Again for choral response.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: create a cue for choral response.

---

### 9. Engage All Students: Make Sure All Students Participate

- Make sure to call on all students.
- Cold call students.
- Implement brief (15–30 second) Turn & Talks.
- Intentionally alternate among multiple methods in class discussion: cold calling, choral response, all hands, and Turn & Talks.

#### Coaching Guide: Call on All Students

**When to Use It:** Teacher tends to call on the same few students over and over.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's look at this footage from some of your questioning sequences in the past week. Which students are you calling on and which aren't getting called?"
- "What could you do to make sure you call on all students? How will you remember to do so in-the-moment?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Option 1 — embed in lesson plan: write into plan which specific students to call on, ensuring that students at different levels of mastery are getting called on and that everyone gets to speak frequently.
- Option 2 — use attendance list: pull out teacher attendance list and have teacher check students off as they are called on.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Non-verbal: point to the student who would be ideal for him or her to call on.

#### Coaching Guide: Cold Call

**When to Use It:** Some students disengage when the teacher asks a question.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the purpose of cold calling?"
- "Where in your lesson today could a cold call have increased engagement?"
- "Who are the students who would benefit the most from a cold call?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Choose students to cold call in advance.
- Practice: run through a questioning sequence and strategically cold calling on various students.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Non-verbal: point at the ideal student for the teacher to cold call.

#### Coaching Guide: Turn & Talk

**When to Use It:** Students become restless during lengthy I Do or class discussion.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What are the benefits of having students do a Turn & Talk?"
- "What are the keys to an effective Turn & Talk?"
- "How will you know the Turn and Talk is effective?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Planning: ID moments in upcoming lesson to do a quick Turn & Talk.
- Create bright lines — make Turn & Talk entry and exit unmistakably crisp: pre-establish whom students turn towards, What to Do instructions, brisk signals, "Go!"
- Scan the room and redirect off-task students.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: forefingers turn toward each other.
- Model: lead a Turn and Talk and then explain rationale to teacher during the Turn and Talk.

#### Coaching Guide: Use Multiple Methods to Call on Students

**When to Use It:** Teacher over-relies on just one technique for engaging all students.

**Probing Questions:**
- "We've discussed multiple ways to call on students: cold call, taking hands, turn & talks, and choral response. Which ones do you use the most? Which ones could you use more frequently in your lesson?"
- "What are the times in which each technique would be best to use in your class?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan a whole group discussion: note which questions are best suited for cold call, hands, choral response or turn & talk.
- Role play the discussion following the script the teacher created.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Non-verbal: create/use cue for cold call, choral response and all hands.
- Whisper prompt: "When you call the group back together, start with a choral response."
- Model (if needed).

---

### 10. Narrate the Positive

- Narrate what students do well, not what they do wrong. Examples: "I like how Javon has gotten straight to work on his writing assignment." / "The second row is ready to go: their pencils are in the well and their eyes are on me."
- While narrating the positive and/or while scanning during a redirect, look at the student(s) who are off-task.
- Use language that reinforces students getting smarter: praise answers that are above and beyond or reflect strong effort.

#### Coaching Guide: Narrate What Students Do Well

**When to Use It:** Teacher's tone when addressing management problems is overly negative.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch model video] "How did the teacher get students to correct misbehaviors without being negative?"
- [Watch video of teacher] "What could you have done in this particular moment to increase the positivity of your tone?"
- "What negative phrases do you find yourself using most often?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Planning: re-write teacher's most frequent negative comments into positive statements.
- Practice: role play keeping students on track through positive narration.
- Focus on the positive tone: practice tone until it feels authentic — not overly positive nor too flat/negative.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: index card with a plus sign written on it.
- Whisper prompt: "Narrate the positive."

#### Coaching Guide: While Narrating the Positive, Look at Off-Task Student

**When to Use It:** Students who are off-task don't respond to positive narration.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch model video] "Where is the teacher looking while narrating the positive? How does that affect student responsiveness?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Practice: you play the role of a student and model off-task behavior while the teacher looks at you and narrates the positive actions of another (imaginary) student.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Whisper prompt: "Look at off-task students while narrating positive."

#### Coaching Guide: Use Language that Reinforces Students Getting Smarter

**When to Use It:** Teacher tends to praise behavior rather than academic effort or achievement.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch model video] "What does this teacher say when her students are responding? What behavior is she reinforcing?"
- "When do you find yourself giving positive feedback to students?"
- "What are the classroom culture benefits of praising academics over behavior?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan: With an upcoming lesson plan, script moments when the teacher could give precise academic praise that would reinforce students' effort.
- Practice students giving a response and the teacher giving precise praise.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Model: praise student thinking if an opportunity is missed.
- Whisper to teacher to give precise praise after another positive academic behavior.

---

### 11. Individual Student Corrections

Anticipate student off-task behavior and rehearse the next two things you will do when that behavior occurs. Redirect students using the **least invasive intervention** necessary (in escalating order):
1. Proximity
2. Eye contact
3. Use a non-verbal
4. Say student's name quickly
5. Small consequence

#### Coaching Guide: Least-Invasive Intervention

**When to Use It:** Teacher sees the problem, but What to Do and Narrate the Positive aren't working for a few students, or teacher does not consistently or effectively provide consequences for minor misbehaviors. Teacher uses corrections that draw unnecessary attention to the student who has been off-task.

**Probing Questions:**
- "When a student shows ___ [insert low-level nonresponsiveness, such as calling out, repeated head down, off-task, etc.], what is your ideal response?"
- "What is the challenge when you try to redirect an off-task student?"
- "Look at this list of interventions from least to most invasive. What is the advantage of starting with the least invasive intervention?"
- "When you are intervening with off-task students, which of these interventions are you using? Which ones could you add to your repertoire?" [Watch video of teaching if needed.]
- "Which intervention is most appropriate given the behavior and the part of the lesson in which it occurs?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- You really cannot over-plan and over-practice this action step. The more at-bats the better!
- Script the precise language of administering the consequence.
- Practice the tone and timing until teacher has mastered a formal tone.
- Role play as a student with different types of off-task behavior. Have the teacher re-direct you with least-invasive interventions. Slowly progress up to persisting in the off-task behavior so that the teacher has a chance to escalate to every type of intervention.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: point to the student off-task and give a re-direct signal.
- Whisper prompt: "This student is off task. Use ___ intervention."
- Model: re-direct an off-task student and wait for the teacher to repeat the action with the next off-task student.

---

## Phase 4: Days 61–90 — Set Routines for Discourse

### 12. Engaged Small Group Work: Maximize Learning During Group Work

**Deliver explicit step-by-step instructions for group work:**
- Make group tasks visible/easily observable (e.g., a handout to fill in, notes to take, product to build).
- Create a role for every person (each group no larger than the number of roles needed).
- Give timed instructions, with benchmarks for where the group should be after each time window.

**Monitor the visual evidence of group progress:**
- Check in on each group every 5–10 minutes to monitor progress.

**Verbally enforce individual & group accountability:**
- "You are five minutes behind; get on track."
- "Brandon: focus."

#### Coaching Guide: Explicit Instructions for Group Work

**When to Use It:** Groups are off task because they're confused about what to do, or because not every student has something to do.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What do you want students doing during group work? What will they have produced if they are successful?"
- "How many student roles do you need in order for your students to complete their group work task? Based on that, what size should the groups be?"
- "What will be the hardest part to enforce? What visual evidence can you create to make it easier for you to make sure they're on track?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Planning: script out explicit directions for group work.
- Focus on visual evidence of on-task behavior: to make it easier to monitor (e.g., students chart their thoughts on the whiteboard).
- Practice delivery.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Model delivering explicit small group work instructions.

#### Coaching Guide: Monitor & Verbally Enforce Group Accountability

**When to Use It:** Some groups are off-task despite clear instructions.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Despite your quality instructions, you had a few groups who weren't on task today. Did you notice when they started to get off track?"
- "Looking back on your previously learned action steps, what sort of small-group reset or individual correction could you deliver to get the group/individual back on track?"
- "In which groups were some students shouldering more of the work? What steps can you take to remedy this?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan out what the teacher will want to see on chart paper/student notebooks during group work.
- For resetting, script out the language for an effective reset or individual correction. Incorporate all the keys from previous action steps.
- Practice: Monitor group work and practice individual student corrections and whole-class reset.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal or whisper prompt: ID the off-task groups.
