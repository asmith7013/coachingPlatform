## Phase 1: Pre-Teaching (Summer PD) — Write Lesson Plans

### 1. Develop Effective Lesson Plans 101: Build the Foundation

**Write precise learning objectives that are:**
- Data-driven (rooted in what students need to learn based on analysis of assessment results)
- Curriculum plan-driven
- Able to be accomplished in one lesson

**Additional planning steps:**
- Script a basic "I Do" as a core part of the lesson.
- Design an exit ticket (brief final mini-assessment) aligned to the objective.

#### Coaching Guide: Write Precise Learning Objectives

**When to Use It:** Lesson objectives are not data-driven, are not manageable and measurable, or have not been identified at all.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's look at the upcoming assessment and the questions related to this objective. What do students have to know and do to be able to answer one of these questions correctly?"
- "If you asked them how they know their answer is correct, what key conceptual understanding do you want them to be able to articulate?"
- (After breaking down all the skills/knowledge required to answer the assessment tasks): "Of all the skills/knowledge, what are the most important parts for you to address in this lesson? Which do students already have some mastery of, and which are the key next skills to push them further?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Pull out upcoming assessments to identify the right end goal: break down too-broad objectives to make them manageable for individual lessons.
- Plan & Practice are identical: plan a full week of upcoming objectives together.
- Make sure you have all materials at hand during the meeting: upcoming lesson plans, curriculum scope and sequence, interim assessment, final exam/state test released items, etc.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

#### Coaching Guide: Script a Basic "I Do"

**When to Use It:** Teacher stumbles or doesn't know what to say during the "I Do" part of the lesson.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's look at your objective and the key understandings that students need to have in order to master it. How will you explain those key understandings?"
- "What will be the key points of confusion for many of the students? Given that answer, where should you emphasize your points most clearly to address that confusion?"
- "What are the key points you want to communicate during the 'I Do'?"
- "How can you write out your 'I Do' to make it easy to remember and deliver in the moment?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan: Write out key understandings students must reach by the end of the lesson.
- Script "I Do" into the lesson plan word for word. Remove extraneous words. Don't begin practice until you have fully tightened the script.
- Practice delivering: look for the teacher adding extraneous words or sentences that you could cut to reduce the model to what is essential.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: Hold out your palm and point to it with the other hand to indicate to them to go back to their script and follow it.

#### Coaching Guide: Design Exit Ticket Aligned to the Objective

**When to Use It:** Teacher's exit ticket doesn't align to the objective.

**Probing Questions:**
- "When you finish the class, what will students be able to do to show you that they have mastered the objective?"
- "What key question/task could you give them at the end of the lesson to assess that mastery?"
- "Look at the upcoming interim assessment/year-end test: how can we align your question to that level of difficulty and rigor?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan/revise a week's worth of exit tickets. Have the upcoming interim/year-end assessment questions in hand to help set the rigor of the Exit Ticket.
- Look at previous exit tickets to see where students are struggling and what skills need to continue to be assessed.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

---

### 2. Internalize Existing Lesson Plans: Make Existing Plans Your Own

- Internalize & rehearse key parts of the lesson, including the "I Do" and all key instructions.
- Build time stamps into the lesson plan and follow them.

#### Coaching Guide: Internalize Key Parts of the Lesson

**When to Use It:** Teacher hasn't internalized the lesson, and may stumble when delivering it.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What parts of the lesson plan are most important for you to know cold? What is the value of memorizing these parts of the lesson?"
- "How do you normally prepare and internalize a lesson plan?"
- "What are the challenges to remembering these plans during delivery?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Give the teacher a set time to learn a specific chunk of the lesson cold, and then have him/her try delivering it to a partner without looking down at the lesson.
- Practice one chunk of the lesson at a time. Once a teacher has it cold, put those chunks together until s/he has it completely memorized.
- Build a lesson internalization routine: determine when s/he will spend time each day memorizing key parts of the lesson, how s/he will practice, and who will be their practice partner (even if the "partner" is as basic as a mirror).

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Model: when teacher is struggling with the lesson plan, intervene and cue students to Turn & Talk. Give teacher 30–60 seconds to skim the plan before jumping back into the lesson.

#### Coaching Guide: Build Time Stamps into Lesson

**When to Use It:** The teacher runs out of time, completing only part of the lesson plan and leaving large chunks untaught.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the ideal amount of time you want for independent practice at the end? What are the challenges to making sure that students have that amount of time?"
- "What are the key tasks students need to do to be able to work independently effectively? What are the parts of the lesson we could cut short if you are running out of time?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Write down specific time stamps in their lesson plan. Note which parts of the lesson could be trimmed or cut if teacher is running over.
- Rehearse the lesson with timer in hand. Cut unnecessary language that is slowing the teacher down.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: hold up fingers for how many more minutes to spend in that section of the lesson.

---

## Phase 2: Days 1–30 — Independent Practice

### 3. Write the Exemplar: Set the Bar for Excellence

- Script out the ideal written responses you want students to produce during independent practice.
- Align independent practice to the rigor of the upcoming interim assessment.

#### Coaching Guide: Script the Ideal Written Student Response

**When to Use It:** The teacher doesn't know what a rigorous student response to a question looks like.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's pull out independent practice task. What do you want students to write when you give them this task? [If not yet written] Take a few minutes to write your exemplar."
- "What answers would be only partially correct?"
- "How do you want students to show or organize their work in answering this question?"
- "What are the advantages of writing an exemplar response? How is it different from writing objectives?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Write or revise exemplars for a written-response question in upcoming lessons.
- "Spar" with another exemplar: either another teacher's exemplar or experts in the field (e.g., Shakespearean critics).
- Break down the exemplar: ID key things the student will need to do to produce a response of the same quality.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

#### Coaching Guide: Align Independent Practice to the Assessment

**When to Use It:** Independent practice activities are not as rigorous as the final assessment students are working towards.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's look at the upcoming assessment. What is the gap between the rigor of your independent practice and the assessment?"
- "What can we do to make the independent practice more aligned to the rigor of the end goal?"
- [If teacher struggles to see the gap, use a model]: "Here are two different independent practice activities. Why is activity #1 more aligned and more rigorous than activity #2?" [Teacher responds] "What are your key takeaways for designing quality independent practice tasks?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Pull up a lesson plan and upcoming assessment: write/revise independent practice to match the rigor of the upcoming assessment.
- Write scaffolded questions that ramp up to the rigor of the final assessment question.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

---

### 4. Independent Practice: Build Daily Routines for Student Practice

- **Write first, talk second:** Give students writing tasks to complete prior to class discussion, so that every student answers independently before hearing peers' contributions.
- Implement a **daily entry prompt (Do Now)** to either introduce the day's objective or review material from the previous day.
- Implement and review a longer independent practice and/or a **daily Exit Ticket** (brief final mini-assessment aligned to the objective) to see how many students mastered the concept.

#### Coaching Guide: Write First, Talk Second

**When to Use It:** Class discussion begins without students having the opportunity to write first.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the value of having students write before beginning class discussion?"
- "What is the most important information you want students to grapple with/write about before beginning the conversation?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan lessons that consistently place writing time before discussion: annotate a week's worth of lesson plans with short moments to write before talking.
- Minimal role play: practice the launch of the writing task and bringing students back to discussion afterwards.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

#### Coaching Guide: Daily Entry Prompt (Do Now)

**When to Use It:** Teacher begins class before students have had a chance to write/work independently.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the purpose of a Do Now?"
- Timing: "How long are students spending on the Do Now?" [If too long] "How can we reduce the Do Now so that students finish earlier?"
- Relevance: "What should be the purpose of your Do Now in this lesson: tell you how well students learned the content from yesterday? Or prepare them to learn the content you're teaching today?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Write Do Now questions for upcoming lessons: short (3–5 minutes to complete), easy to monitor (can check student work) and aligned to objective.
- Rehearse a start-of-class greeting that will prompt the students to begin working on the Do Now.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

#### Coaching Guide: Exit Ticket or Longer Independent Practice

**When to Use It:** Lessons include less than 10 minutes worth of independent practice.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the purpose of daily independent practice/exit tickets?"
- Timing: "How long are students spending on independent practice/exit tickets?"
- Relevance: "What do you need your Exit Ticket to tell about what students learned today?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- If challenge is quality of exit ticket: write exit tickets that confirm student mastery. Look at IP and exit tickets side-by-side to make sure they align in level of rigor.
- If challenge is delivery: spend time on the instructions they give to students during the times, integrating management action steps: Strong Voice, What to Do, Radar.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

### 5. Monitor Aggressively: Check Independent Work

**Create & implement a monitoring pathway:**
- Create a seating chart to monitor students most effectively.
- Monitor the fastest writers first, then the students who need more support.

**Monitor the quality of student work:**
- Check answers against your exemplar.
- Track correct and incorrect answers to class questions.

**Pen in hand — mark up student work as you circulate:**
- Use a coding system to affirm correct answers.
- Cue students to revise answers using minimal verbal intervention (name the error, ask them to fix it, tell them you'll follow up).

#### Coaching Guide: Monitoring Pathway

**When to Use It:** Teacher monitors only a handful of students — or none at all — during independent practice.

**Probing Questions:**
- Watch a model video: "What does the teacher do after launching independent practice?"
- "What do you notice about this seating chart from your peer — what about it would make it easier to monitor your students' work?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Pull out seating charts from other teachers to use as guides.
- Create a seating chart for this teacher's class with data in hand & plan the monitoring pathway: start with fastest writers and then move to the ones who need more time.
- Practice: test out the seating chart walking around. Revise for anticipated management/off-task behavior.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal or whisper prompt: Cue teacher to follow his/her planned pathway.

#### Coaching Guide: Monitor the Quality of Student Work

**When to Use It:** Teacher does not see patterns in student answers.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What were the challenges for you as you monitored during independent practice? What made it difficult for you to remember all your students' answers?"
- "If you cannot monitor everything a student writes, what are the key pieces based on today's focus?"
- "What trends did you notice as you aggressively monitored the independent work today? Who mastered it and who didn't?"
- "What is the purpose of aggressive monitoring during independent practice? How can that help inform the rest of your lesson?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Planning: take out the exemplar and annotate for the keys to look for: Humanities — the argument/thesis, evidence, or a writing technique; STEM — a certain formula or critical step in answering a problem.
- Set up a note-taking template for monitoring.
- Practice: set out papers with student writing on desks, and give the teacher a set amount of time to fill in note-taking template and note the patterns in student responses.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Whisper prompt: Cue teacher to monitor student work.
- Model: Walk alongside teacher and ask what trends s/he is noticing. Show teacher how to use exemplar to identify patterns and determine the trend.

#### Coaching Guide: Mark Up Student Work (Pen in Hand)

**When to Use It:** Teacher is not giving explicit feedback to more than a handful of students if at all.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the student experiencing in the moment when you're monitoring? How many of them know if they are on the right track or not?"
- [Present a coding technique/watch a video of a teacher marking up student work/look at a sample student work that has been marked up by a teacher] "How did the teacher give quick feedback to this student to help them get on track?"
- "What is the power of a coding system for allowing you to give feedback to more students?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Create a feedback code: simple cues to write on student work to spur self-correction.
- Practice: put out a class set of student work on all the desks. Have the teacher monitor the room and write feedback codes on as many papers as possible.
- Rd 2: ID ways to go faster.
- Integrate previous actions: monitoring pathway; collecting data.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Model: Walk alongside the teacher as they monitor and whisper, e.g., "I think you should put an E on this one" when you see him/her struggle to give the student feedback.

## Phase 3: Days 31–60 — Respond to Student Learning Needs

### 6. Habits of Evidence

- Teach students to annotate with purpose: summarize, analyze, find the best evidence, etc.
- Teach and prompt students to cite key evidence in their responses.

#### Coaching Guide: Teach Students to Annotate with Purpose

**When to Use It:** Students don't annotate texts when reading, making it difficult for them to go back and cite the best evidence.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the purpose of annotating a text? Based on your prompt/task, what would be the best focus for their annotation?"
- "How many students are annotating the text while reading?"
- "For the students that are annotating, what are the biggest gaps in their ability to annotate for the best evidence?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Review text the students will be reading in the upcoming week. Create an exemplar annotation: what are the key pieces of evidence you would like them to highlight.
- Practice: monitor student work with annotated exemplar on a clipboard.
- Set up a simple written feedback/cue to give to students while monitoring their annotation (e.g., circle = look for better evidence).

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Walk alongside the teacher when monitoring student annotation of their reading. Look for patterns of good and weak annotations. Whisper prompt: "Prompt x student to improve their annotations."

#### Coaching Guide: Teach/Prompt Students to Cite Key Evidence

**When to Use It:** Students don't cite evidence from the text when answering questions.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the importance of citing evidence in answering a question?"
- "Where in your last lesson could students have been asked to cite their evidence more clearly/effectively?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Name key evidence from exemplar, identify additional valid evidence, and predict wrong evidence.
- Practice: prompt students when they don't cite best evidence.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Cue for evidence (e.g., card with an "E" printed on it).
- Whisper prompt: "Ask for evidence." Model if needed.

---

### 7. Check for Whole-Group Understanding

**Poll the room to determine how students are answering a question:**
- "How many chose letter A? B? C? D?"
- Students answer on whiteboards: "Hold up your whiteboards on the count of three…"

**Target the error:** Focus class discussion on the questions where students most struggle to answer correctly.

#### Coaching Guide: Poll the Room

**When to Use It:** Teacher moves ahead without a clear vision of which (or how many) students comprehend.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Debrief your own intervention] "I intervened in your class and polled the room. What was the purpose of doing so? How did that help guide the rest of your lesson?"
- "What would be the best moments in your upcoming lesson to poll the room?"
- "What are the advantages these polling techniques versus self-report thumbs up/thumbs down?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Script into the lesson plan key moments to conduct a poll of the room.
- Plan the rollout of the polling routine: integrate Phase 1 & 2 actions for rollouts.
- Predict the outcome for the polling of upcoming classes to help a teacher start to anticipate student error.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Hold up sign that says "Poll."
- Model: Poll the room yourself.

#### Coaching Guide: Target the Error

**When to Use It:** Class discussion does not focus on students' common misconceptions.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What challenges do you anticipate during independent practice? Where is the most important area to review?"
- [Watch model video]: "What actions does this teacher take to respond to students' written errors?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Planning: Anticipate the errors students will make in upcoming lesson.
- Practice: Review student work and name the error.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Whisper Prompt during IP: "What patterns of error are you noticing? Plan to review only the areas of error."

---

### 8. Re-teaching 101 — Model: Show Students How to Think/Solve/Write

**Give students a clear listening/note-taking task that fosters active listening, then debrief the model:**
- "What did I do in my model?"
- "What are the key things to remember when you are doing the same in your own work?"

**Model the thinking, not just a procedure:**
- Narrow the focus to the thinking students are struggling with.
- Model replicable thinking steps that students can follow.
- Model how to activate one's own content knowledge and skills learned in previous lessons.
- Vary the think-aloud in tone and cadence from the normal "teacher" voice to highlight the thinking skills.

**We Do and You Do:** Give students opportunities to practice with your guidance.

#### Coaching Guide: Give Students a Clear Listening/Note-taking Task

**When to Use It:** The teacher gives a clear model, but the students don't have a task to do while listening to the model.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch a model video]: "What were the key actions the teacher took to make sure the students were listening?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Focus on planning: include a note-taking task and check for understanding.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Verbal Prompt: "Students, I want to see your notebooks out to take notes: This is too valuable not to write anything down!"

#### Coaching Guide: Model the Thinking, Not Just a Procedure

**When to Use It:** The teacher's model is confusing or unclear, OR the teacher tells them a procedure but doesn't unpack the thinking behind it.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's look over your exemplar for the independent practice. Talk aloud how you would solve this problem/write this essay." [After teacher answer] "What are students struggling to do to match the quality of your exemplar? Where is their thinking or understanding breaking down?"
- "Given those gaps, what is the most important thing for you to model for them?"
- [Watch a model video]: "What were the key actions the teacher took to model the skill effectively? How do those differ from what you have been doing in class?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Pre-work: unpack the key errors that students are making (Phase 3 coaching tips: 1. Start with the exemplar. 2. Identify the gaps. 3. Plan the re-teach).
- Plan: design an effective Think Aloud (1. Target the error. 2. Model replicable thinking. 3. Check for understanding.)
- Practice: vary tone and cadence of think aloud/model to emphasize key points and be as clear as possible.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Verbal Prompt: "Ms. Smith, that was very interesting. Can you tell me again what you were thinking when you took that step? I want to make sure I understand."
- Model: do a Think Aloud yourself.

#### Coaching Guide: We Do/You Do — Give At-Bats to Practice

**When to Use It:** The teacher gives a clear model, but the students don't have the opportunity to try to replicate it after the model is done.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the best way for students to practice after they have listened to your model?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan: create an At-bat where students genuinely practice what the teacher just modeled. Make sure they practice the thinking involved and not just the procedure.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: Give a cue that it's time for students to practice.

---

## Phase 4: Days 61–90 — Lead Student Discourse 101

### 9. Re-teaching 201 — Guided Discourse: Let Students Unpack Their Own Errors

- **Show-Call:** Post student work (either an exemplar or incorrect response) and ask students to identify why that answer is correct/incorrect.
- **Stamp the understanding:** "What are the keys to remember when solving problems like these?" or "Can someone give me a rule?" (Students use their own words.)
- **Give them At-bats:** Give students opportunities to practice with your guidance.

#### Coaching Guide: Show-Call

**When to Use It:** Many students are struggling to identify the error in their understanding, or they struggle to generate an exemplar response. Teacher is trying to use student work but struggles to lead discussion around it.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch video of Show-Call] "What was the value of the teacher showing a piece of student work to jump-start the conversation? How did the teacher do this effectively?"
- "What common errors are your students making when solving these problems/completing these types of tasks?"
- "When looking at student work, what do they need to see more: an exemplar response from their peer, or the error that they are making?"
- "What would an ideal answer from a student look like?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Planning: Look at exit tickets and select a strong student exemplar and a representative incorrect/incomplete student response that is indicative of an error that many students are making.
- Script out the steps: 1. Post the work (either exemplar, incorrect answer, or both). 2. Turn & talk: ask students to evaluate. 3. Whole class: name the error and the best practice.
- Practice: rehearse the script. Focus on economy of language.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Whisper prompt: during independent practice, identify one or more student work samples that would be valuable for the teacher to use during Show Call. Ask the teacher which ones they would Show-Call; if they make a weak choice, show them the ones you selected and briefly explain why.

#### Coaching Guide: Stamp the Understanding and At-Bats

**When to Use It:** Students can figure out their error, but they do not articulate clearly what they have to do to prevent those errors in the future and don't have time to practice.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Once the students identify the error or strategies in the exemplar, what is the key understanding you want them to stamp? What would the ideal answer look like?"
- "What would be the best form of practice for the students to get a chance to master this new strategy/understanding?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Practice stamping the understanding: articulate exactly what the teacher will look for in student answers. Write down that key understanding on the board.
- Plan: Incorporate into lesson plan more "at bats" to practice the new skill.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Model: if teacher doesn't stamp the understanding, intervene to make sure students grasp the concept.
- Nonverbal: give cue that it's time for students to practice.

---

### 10. Universal Prompts: Push Thinking Back on Students

- **Wait time:** Provide wait time after posing challenging questions.
- **Pre-call:** Let a student who needs more time know you're calling on them next.
- **Roll back the answer:** Repeat the wrong answer back to the student (gives the student time to think and you time to build a plan).
- **Elaboration prompts:** "Tell me more." / "What makes you think that?" / "How do you know?" / "Why is that important?"
- **Close the loop:** After correcting an error, go back to students with wrong answers to have them revise their answers.

#### Coaching Guide: Wait Time, Pre-Call, Roll Back

**When to Use It:** The teacher moves on too quickly after asking a challenging question.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What are the possible reasons a student might not be able to answer a question you ask on the spot — beyond just not knowing the answer?"
- [Watch a video or model for the teacher] "What actions did the teacher take? Why were these beneficial?"
- "What is the purpose of repeating the student's answer back to him/her? Why not just correct the error?"
- "Which students need more time than others to formulate an answer? Which ones would benefit from a pre-call to give them enough thinking time?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Integrate the practice of all three skills:
- Wait time: ID higher-order questions that might require more think time. Script concise directions teacher will narrate during wait time ("This answer requires strong evidence. Everyone can be looking as we wait.")
- Roll back: role play a questioning sequence from an upcoming lesson, providing student answers that would benefit from rolling back. Continue the lesson after rolling back as well.
- Pre-Call: ID the students who would benefit from a pre call. Pick the questions in the lesson plan that would be ideal to ask those students.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: create a cue for wait time (e.g., hold up a hand as a stop sign).
- Model: roll back answer to original student, modeling for teacher.

#### Coaching Guide: Universal Prompts (Elaboration)

**When to Use It:** The teacher doesn't know why a student got an answer wrong.

**Probing Questions:**
- "When the student delivered the incorrect answer, what happened next? How do you know if that student now understands at the end of the class?"
- "Let's look at this list of universal prompts. What is the value of using prompts like these?"
- "Where in your lesson could you have used one or more of these prompts?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan next lesson: predict the types of student responses that will benefit from these prompts.
- Practice: play the roles of 3–4 different students: one with a wrong answer, two more with limited answers. Role play using each of the prompts.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

#### Coaching Guide: Close the Loop

**When to Use It:** After an incorrect answer, the teacher moves on without correcting the original error with that student.

**Probing Questions:**
- "When [student] delivered that incorrect answer yesterday, what did you do next? How did you know if [student] understood why she/he was wrong? What could you do next time?"
- [Watch model video]: "How does this teacher guarantee that the student has learned after his original misconception?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Role-play a questioning sequence from an upcoming lesson, with you playing different students so that the teacher has a chance to play out the process of coming back to the first student he or she has called on.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Whisper prompt: "Come back to x student to make sure he understands."
- Model: "Jared, why is that answer right?"

---

### 11. Habits of Discussion: Strengthen Class Conversation

- **Keep neutral / manage your tell:** Don't reveal the right/wrong answer through your reaction to the student response.
- **Agree / Build off of:** "I agree with ____ and I'd like to add…."
- **Disagree respectfully:** "While I agree with [this part of your argument], I disagree with ____. I would argue…."

#### Coaching Guide: Keep Neutral

**When to Use It:** The teacher's reaction reveals whether student responses are correct before the students can figure it out on their own.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Recall our recent PD on Habits of Discussion. What is the goal of getting students to use the habits?"
- [Watch video of teacher] "Compare your responses to correct and incorrect answers. What are the differences? How do your different responses limit the rigor of the discussion?"
- "What actions can you take to ensure your responses to correct and incorrect responses are the same?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Practice: role play correct and incorrect responses. Focus teacher on staying neutral: eyebrows neutral, consistent nodding or not, same number of words after each response.
- Incorporate in the use of habits of discussion and wait time.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** N/A

#### Coaching Guide: Agree/Build Off Each Other

**When to Use It:** Student answers are disconnected from each other even when they agree.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What do you ideally want students to do when they agree with what a peer is saying? How could you get them to do it in-the-moment?"
- "Let's think about that moment during your lesson when x student shared his answer and the next student just repeated it. What training do the students need in how to build off of another answer?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Script prompts to get students to build off of each other's arguments: "I agree with ___, and I would like to add that…"
- Practice: Role-play a class discussion. Prompt the students to build off.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Post the Habits of Discussion in the classroom; point to the posted habits when needed.
- Model: "David [student], can you restate your answer using one of the habits?"

#### Coaching Guide: Disagree Respectfully

**When to Use It:** Students either don't disagree with their peers, or don't do so in a respectful manner.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What do you ideally want students to do when they disagree with what a peer is saying?"
- "What is the gap between that ideal response and what they are doing in class?"
- "How could you get them to do those ideal actions in-the-moment?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Script prompts to get students to respectfully disagree with each other's arguments.
- Practice: Role-play a class discussion. Prompt the students to express respectful disagreement.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Point to prompts posted on the classroom walls.
- Model: "Laura, can you disagree using one of the habits posted on the wall?"

---

## Stretch It (Next Steps) — Lead Student Discourse 201

### 12. Strategic Prompts: Ask Strategic Questions in Response to Student Error

**Prompt students to access previously learned knowledge:**
- Point students to resources (notes, posted concepts and content).
- "What do we know about _____ [content students learned in previous classes]?"
- Use a prompting guide (e.g., Great Habits, Great Readers Guided Reading Prompting Guide) to design questions.

**Call on students based on their learning needs (data-driven):**
- Call on lower and middle-achieving students to unpack the question.
- If they struggle, try a higher-achieving student.
- If they are easily unpacking, try a lower-achieving student.
- Create a sequence of students to call on based on the rigor of each prompt (e.g., first ask middle student, then low, then high).

**Students prompting students:**
- Push students to use habits of discussion to critique or push one another's answers.
- Probe deeper: "[Peer], have you considered this point…?"

#### Coaching Guide: Access Previous Understanding

**When to Use It:** Despite the use of Discourse 101 techniques, students are still unable to grasp the concept.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's look at yesterday's lesson. What were the key understandings you wanted the students to reach by the end of the class?"
- "Where was the gap in their ability to get there?"
- "Think about your previous learning. What are the key understandings that could have helped the students unpack this task/question?"
- "What are the resources you have available that have a set of prompts you can use with your kids?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan: Unpack the exemplar response in upcoming lesson, & name the key pieces of previous understanding that students will need to solve the problem.
- Prepare where students will access that knowledge (e.g.: Chart of key terms posted in the room, student handout, previous notes).
- Plan the script to ask students to access that knowledge.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: Point to the resources in the room.
- Whisper prompt: "I think students are making ____ error. Ask them about _____ [previously learned knowledge or skill] to cue them to strategies that can help them solve the problem."

#### Coaching Guide: Call on Students Based on Data

**When to Use It:** The teacher calls primarily students who already know the answer and doesn't guarantee that the learning for the rest, OR teacher calls on consecutive struggling students and the discussion stalls.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Recall the moment when Javier, Claire and Marta all struggled to answer the question. Based on your monitoring of their independent practice prior to the discussion, were there any other students in the room who could have provided more help? What is the advantage of calling on one of them when other students are stuck?"
- "Let's look at your recent assessment data sorted from lowest to highest performing. Think back to whom you called on in class today — where did most of the called-on students fall within your data set? What is the limitation of calling only on students in that range?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Plan: anticipate the responses students of varying levels will give in class.
- Script out the order of students to call on during the discourse: 1. Start with a medium/lower student. 2. Call on a higher student when the previous student is struggling to answer. 3. Call on a lower student to "stamp" the understanding.
- Rd 1: First student called on gets it right (then call on lower/medium students to solidify understanding).
- Rd 2: First student gets it wrong; after calling on higher students, lower students get it right.
- Rd 3: First student gets it wrong, after calling on higher student, lower student still gets it wrong.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** The key to real-time feedback is monitoring student learning during independent practice. Without that, it's difficult to intervene.

#### Coaching Guide: Students Prompting Students

**When to Use It:** Teacher is constantly prompting the students to use habits of discussion because students are not yet taking leadership.

**Probing Questions:**
- [Watch video of class or remember it] "Where did the discussion go off track? What would have been the ideal student intervention to get back on point?"
- [Use Guide for Habits of Discussion] "Which would be the appropriate next habits to develop in the students' ability to lead the discussion?"
- "Recall how you rolled out Routines and Procedures at the beginning of the year. What are the key actions that we can replicate in rolling out a habit of discussion?" [Refer to actions in Phase 1]

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Identify 1–2 common errors and the universal prompts you want students to use to address the error. Practice prompting students to use that universal prompt.
- Practice rolling out the habit [see Phase 1 for key actions].

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:**
- Nonverbal: point to teacher's chart for universal prompts.
- Model: "Daniela [student], what could you say to your peers to prompt a deeper response?"

### 13. Go Conceptual: Get Students to Do the Conceptual Thinking

**Ask students to verbalize conceptual understanding, not just answers:**
- "That's the procedure. Now tell me why that works."
- "Can you generalize that idea to apply to all problems like this one?"
- "Use the following terms [terms learned in previous classes] in restating your answer."

**Upgrade vocabulary — ask students to use technical/academic language:**
- "That's the right idea generally. Now state it again using proper mathematical/historical/scientific language."
- "Correct. Now state it again using your Academic Word Wall as a resource."

**Stretch it — ask students to answer more difficult extensions:**
- "What would the answer be if I changed it to [more complex problem]?"
- "Is there an alternative way to solve this problem/do this task?"
- "What do you think is the strongest counter-argument to yours and how would you refute it?"

#### Coaching Guide: Verbalize a Conceptual Understanding of Content

**When to Use It:** The student gives a correct answer but teacher doesn't ask for him/her to explain why. Teacher focuses on the process but doesn't get students to name the conceptual understanding.

**Probing Questions:**
- "Let's look back at the standard aligned to this task: What are the key understandings required to master this objective?"
- "When you ask a student to explain why [the answer is correct], what is the ideal response you're looking for in this moment?"
- "What response did students give you and how did you respond?"
- "Looking at the potential prompts for conceptual understanding, which would be most relevant to use in this context?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Script ideal response and questioning sequence to get to that response.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Model: "Mr. Smith, I'm impressed with Jordan's answer. Jordan, can you generalize the _____ [rule/strategy/skill] you used that we could use in any problem?"

#### Coaching Guide: Upgrade Vocabulary

**When to Use It:** Teacher does not ask students to use technical/academic language when giving answers.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What is the ideal academic or technical language that you wanted students to use in their response?"
- "What was the gap between that ideal response and what students said?"
- "How can we create or leverage a resource that will push students to upgrade their vocabulary in their answers?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Create a word wall/chart with key academic terms you will want students to use in their answers.
- Script in moments when the teacher can punch key vocabulary terms when modeling. Script ideal student responses that include key vocabulary terms.
- Script the prompts to use when students don't use mathematical/scientific/academic language: "That's the right idea. Now state it again using your Academic Word Wall as a resource."

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Nonverbal: point to the academic language resource (word wall, cheat sheet, etc.)

#### Coaching Guide: "Stretch It"

**When to Use It:** Students answer a question easily, and teacher moves on rather than pushing them to go further.

**Probing Questions:**
- "What happened after you called on Jermaine and he answered your question correctly? How does that affect his learning? What could you do to raise the rigor for him without making it unmanageable for the rest of the class?"
- [Watch video of stretch it.] "What did the teacher do to stretch the learning?"

**Scenarios to Practice:**
- Identify moments in the lesson plan where students might get to correct answers easily. Script "stretch it" questions to increase the rigor of those moments: e.g., how/why, cite evidence, evaluate the answer.

**Cues for Real-Time Feedback:** Non-verbal: pull your fingers apart — as if stretching a piece of gum — to signal that it's a good time to raise the rigor with a stretch-it question.
