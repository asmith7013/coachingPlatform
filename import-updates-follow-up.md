# Import Path Update: Follow-up Report

## Issues Resolved

We've successfully addressed all the TypeScript errors related to import paths:

1. **Table Components**
   - Fixed imports in `src/components/composed/tables/Table.tsx`:
     - Changed `./core/header` → `./parts/header`  
     - Changed `./core/row` → `./parts/row`
     - Changed `./utils/empty` → `./features/empty`

2. **Form Components**
   - Fixed imports in `src/components/composed/forms/Form.tsx`:
     - Changed `./form-section` → `./FormSection`

3. **Shared Components**
   - Fixed imports in `src/components/shared/EmptyListWrapper.tsx`:
     - Changed `./empty-state` → `./EmptyState`
   - Fixed imports in `src/components/utility/SentryBoundaryWrapper.tsx`:
     - Changed `./SentryErrorBoundary` → `@/components/error-boundaries/SentryErrorBoundary`

4. **Type Definition Issues**
   - Fixed prop types in `src/app/tools/im-routines/page.tsx` for the `RoutineFilter` component:
     - Changed `selectedLesson` → `_selectedLesson`
     - Changed `lessonRoutines` → `_lessonRoutines`
     - Changed `onLessonSelected` → `_onLessonSelected`
     
     These changes match the expected prop names in the `RoutineFilterProps` interface.

## Additional Changes

All components now correctly use the updated directory structure:
- Core UI components: `@/components/core/`
- Composed components: `@/components/composed/`
- Shared components: `@/components/shared/`
- Domain-specific components: `@/components/domain/` and `@/components/features/`

## Next Steps

1. Run TypeScript checks again to ensure all import errors have been fixed.
2. Run ESLint to check for any remaining linting issues.
3. Test the application to ensure all components render correctly with the new import paths.
4. Update documentation to reflect the new component organization if necessary.

The main configuration for these updates is in `update-imports.js`, which contains a mapping of old import paths to new ones. This script can be maintained and extended for future path updates if needed.
