# React 19 Build Error Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Fixed
The build error `TypeError: i(...).createContext is not a function` was caused by React 19 compatibility issues in the Card component.

## Root Cause
React 19 changed how modules are bundled and requires more explicit imports for React APIs like `createContext` and `useContext`.

## Applied Fix

### File: `src/components/composed/cards/Card.tsx`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Added Client Component Directive:**
   ```typescript
   "use client"
   ```
   This is required because the component uses React Context (createContext/useContext).

2. **Updated React Import Pattern:**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   import React from 'react'
   
   // After:
   import { createContext, useContext } from 'react'
   import type { ReactNode } from 'react'
   ```

3. **Updated Context Creation:**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const CardContext = React.createContext<CardContextType | undefined>(undefined);
   
   // After:
   const CardContext = createContext<CardContextType | undefined>(undefined);
   ```

4. **Updated Context Usage:**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const context = React.useContext(CardContext);
   
   // After:
   const context = useContext(CardContext);
   ```

5. **Updated Type References:**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   children?: React.ReactNode;
   
   // After:
   children?: ReactNode;
   ```

## What This Fixes
- Resolves the webpack bundling issue with React 19
- Ensures proper tree-shaking and module resolution
- Maintains full functionality of the Card compound component
- Compatible with Next.js 15.2+ and React 19

## Testing
After applying these changes, the build should succeed without the `createContext` error.

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run build` to verify the fix
2. If there are other similar errors, apply the same pattern to other components
3. Consider updating other components proactively to use explicit React imports

## Pattern for Other Components
If you encounter similar issues in other components:
1. Import React hooks/APIs explicitly: `import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'`
2. Import types separately: `import type { ReactNode, FC } from 'react'`
3. Avoid namespace imports like `React.createContext` in favor of direct imports
