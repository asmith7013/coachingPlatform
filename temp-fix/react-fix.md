# React 19 Build Error Fix

## Problem
The error `TypeError: i(...).createContext is not a function` suggests a React 19 compatibility issue with the Card component's context usage.

## Root Cause
React 19 has changes in how modules are bundled, and there may be an issue with the React import pattern in the Card component.

## Solution
Replace the React import pattern in the Card component to be more explicit and compatible with React 19.

## Files to Fix
- `src/components/composed/cards/Card.tsx`

## Specific Changes

1. Change the React import from:
```typescript
import React from 'react'
```

2. To:
```typescript
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react'
```

3. Replace `React.createContext` with `createContext`
4. Replace `React.useContext` with `useContext`
