## Implementation Log
- Started implementation: Task 1.0 Core Hook Consolidation
- Completed 1.1: Hook dependency analysis created with comprehensive mapping of 5 hooks and consolidation strategy
- Completed 1.2: Created useScheduling master hook interface with unified types and API design
- Completed 1.3: Implemented unified transformation pipeline that eliminates duplication between useScheduleDisplay and useScheduling, includes caching layer and proper error handling
- Completed 1.4: Implemented unified state management with optimized re-render strategy, state synchronization, and conflict detection 
- Completed 1.5: Created 4 specialized utility hooks (useSchedulingPersistence, useSchedulingValidation, useSchedulingInteractions, useSchedulingPerformance) with clean separation of concerns and composition support
